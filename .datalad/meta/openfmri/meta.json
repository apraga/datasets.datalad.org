    "description": "## UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics LA5c Study\n\n## Feedback and Discussion of Dataset DS000030\n\nFeedback, discussions, and comments are welcome. For information on how and where to discuss this data set, please see the OpenfMRI FAQ: https://openfmri.org/faq/ item \"**Is there a place to discuss these datasets with the larger community?**\"\n\n## Data Organization\n\nThe data set is organized in BIDS version 1.0.0rc3 (http://bids.neuroimaging.io) format.\n\n## Subjects / Participants\nThe participants.tsv file contains subject IDs with demographic informations as well as an inventory of the scans that are included for each subject.\n\n## Dataset Derivatives (/derivatives)\nThe /derivaties folder contains summary information that reflects the data and its contents:\n\n1. Final_Scan_Count.pdf - Plot showing the over all scan inclusion, for quick reference.\n2. parameter_plots/ - Folder contains many scan parameters plotted over time. Plot symbols are color coded by imaging site. Intended to provide a general sense of protocol adherence throughout the study. Individual parameters scan be found in the scan .json sidecar file. A single file containing the combined data from all of the imaging .json sidecars if provided in parameter_plots/MR_Scan_Parameters.tsv file.\n3. physio_plots/ - Folder contains a plot of the physiological recording trace for the Breath Hold and Resting State functional scans. For the BHT, the instructional cue timings are represented by shaded background.\n4. event_plots/ - Simple plots of the function task events files. The x-axis is always time (onset), and the y-axis can be task-specific. Also intended as a quick reference or summary.\n5. mriqcp/ - Output of the current version (as of 27 Jan 2016) of MRIQCP (MRI Quality Control Protocol: https://github.com/poldracklab/mriqc). Included are numeric results of anatomical and functional protocols as well as single subject results plotted against group distribution.\n6. data_browser/ - a rudimentary data visualization for MRIQP (see: http://wtriplett.github.io/ds030/)\n\n## Scan-specific Notes\n\nAll scan files were converted from scanner DICOM files using dcm2niix (0c9e5c8 from https://github.com/neurolabusc/dcm2niix.git). Extra DICOM metadata elements were extracted using GDCM (http://gdcm.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) and combined to form each scan's .json sidecar.\n\n**Note regarding scan and task timing**: In most cases, the trigger time was provided in the task data file and has been transferred into the TaskParameter section of each scans *_bold.json file. If the trigger time is available, a correction was performed to the onset times to account for trigger delay. The uncompensated onset times are included in the onset_NoTriggerAdjust column. There will be an 8 second discrepancy between the compensated and uncompensated that accounts for pre-scans (4 TRs) performed by the scanner. In the cases where the trigger time is not available, the output of (TotalScanTime - nVols*RepetitionTime) may provide an estimate of pre-scan time.\n\n### T1w Anatomical\nDefacing was performed using freesurfer mri_deface (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_deface)\n\n    Bischoff-Grethe, Amanda et al. \"A Technique for the Deidentification of Structural Brain MR Images.\" Human brain mapping 28.9 (2007): 892–903. PMC. Web. 27 Jan. 2016.\n\n### PAMenc / PAMret\nThe larger amount of missing PAM scans is due to a task design change early in the study. It was decided that data collected before the design change would be excluded.\n\n### Stop Signal\nThe Stop Signal task consisted of both a training task (no MRI) and the in-scanner fMRI task. The data from the training run is included in each subject's beh folder with the task name \"stopsignaltraining\".",

    "description": "# Training of loss aversion modulates neural sensitivity toward potential gains\n\n## Aims:\n\nWe investigated behavioral and neural mechanisms for modulating loss aversion.\n\n## Methods\n\n*Behavior task:* We adapted the gambling task (Tom et al., 2007) by introducing contexts and feedback that encourage participants to take more or less loss averse choices.\n\n*fMRI:* We used general linear model to find brain activation that correlates with magnitude of potential gains or potential losses during the learning and post-learning probe. We also used psychophysiological interaction analysis (independent seeded at vmPFC) to identified the brain areas showing interaction with vmPFC over the course of training.\n\n## General findings and importance:\n\nTraining primarily modulated behavioral and neural sensitivity toward potential gains, and was reflected in connectivity between regions involved in cognitive control and those involved in value representation. These findings highlight the importance of experience in development of biases in decision-making.\n\n## Sample Size\n\nSixty human participants completed the behavioral paradigm in the MRI scanner (31 females, 29 males; age range: 18 - 30 with mean 22.9-year-old). Two participants were discarded from the brain imaging analyses; one due to a missing anatomical image, and the other due to excessive head movement (more than one-third of the volumes were considered “bad time points” according to the motion correction procedures detailed in the Preprocessing section).\n\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects. The code\ncan be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface\n\nQuality Control\n---------------\nMriqc was run on the dataset. Results are located in derivatives/mriqc.

To include all trials, one can easily create new model files from the behavdata.txt files.  \n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT PREPROCESSING\n\n* Slices were not acquired in interleaved order. Refer to the slice_order.txt file (single column FSL format) if you choose to perform slice timing correction.\n\n* The scanner began the EPI pulse sequence a few seconds prior to the start of recording, so there is no need to discard the first few TRs, as is commonly done with fMRI data. \n\n* EEG wires can create field inhomogeneities that are sometimes visible on the images, particularly on the left posterior region closest to where the wires were bunched together as they exited the coil. Bias field correction can optionally be performed using FSL FAST without the need of a field map.\n\n\n————————————————————————————————\nANATOMICAL MRI DATA\n————————————————————————————————\n\n- highresSPGR001.nii.gz - SPGR 1x1x1 mm (present for all subjects except sub010)\n- highresMPRAGE001.nii.gz - MPRAGE 1x1x1 mm (for sub010 and additionally exists for a few others)\n- highresEPI001.nii.gz - high resolution single volume EPI 2x2x2 mm\n\n\n————————————————————————————————\nSUPPLEMENTARY FILES\n————————————————————————————————\n\nEEG RE-REFERENCING \n\n- shortestpath.m - Matlab function used to re-reference EEG data from 43-channel bipolar pair space to 34-channel electrode space.

Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine time courses of brain activity in 77 individuals aged 8-27 years during correct and incorrect performance of an oculomotor task requiring inhibitory control. Canonical eye-movement regions showed increased activity for correct versus error trials but no differences between children, adolescents and young adults, suggesting that core task processes are in place early in development.",

    "description": "Modafinil is employed for the treatment of narcolepsy and has also been, off-label, used to treat cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders.  In a previous study, we have reported that single dose administration of modafinil in healthy young subjects enhances fluid reasoning and affects resting state activity in the Fronto Parietal Control (FPC) and Dorsal Attention (DAN) networks. No changes were found in the Salience Network (SN), a surprising result as the network is involved in the modulation of emotional and fluid reasoning.  The insula is crucial hub of the SN and functionally divided in anterior and posterior subregions. Using a seed-based approach, we have now analyzed effects of modafinil on the functional connectivity (FC) of insular subregions. Analysis of FC with resting state fMRI (rs-FMRI) revealed increased FC between the right posterior insula and the putamen, the superior frontal gyrus and the anterior cingulate cortex in the modafinil-treated group.Modafinil is considered a putative cognitive enhancer. The rs-fMRI modifications that we have found are consistent with the drug cognitive enhancing properties and indicate subregional targets of action.",

These should be present in the next revision.\n\nWhere to discuss the dataset\n----------------------------\n1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds******/ See the comments section at the bottom of the dataset\npage.\n2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with the tags openfmri and dsXXXXXX\naccession number.\n3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org. Please include the dsXXXXXX accession number \nin\nyour email.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n- The defacing process was quite aggressive for some of the anatomical images, resulting in minor removal of brain. According to the submitter, this is unlikely to have any effect on the BOLD workflow, as the workflow simply registers the mean EPI to the T1.\n- The workflow was created when the dataset was in a different organizational format. Since \nthe dataset has been converted to BIDS, it needs to be updated.\n\nBids-validator Output\n---------------------\n\n\t1: Not all subjects/sessions/runs have the same scanning parameters.

    "description": "# The Stockholm SleepyBrain Project #\n\n## Background and Aim ## \n\nSleepiness is a brain state with pervasive effects on cognitive and\naffective functioning. However, little is known about the functional\nmechanisms and correlates of sleepiness in the awake brain. This project\naimed to investigate overall effects of sleepiness on brain function \nwith particular regard to emotional processing.\n\n## Method and Design ##  \n\nWe investigated the effects of sleep deprivation using a randomized\ncross-over design. Resting state functional connectivity was \ninvestigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). \nEmotional contagion was studied using concurrent fMRI and \nelectromyography (EMG) of facial muscles in response to emotional \nexpressions and empathy for pain was investigated using pictures \nof others receiving pain stimuli. To study emotional reappraisal, \nparticipants were instructed to actively up-regulate or \ndown-regulate their emotional responses to picture stimuli. \nThe participants were characterized using several rating scales, \nbiometric information, and blood sampling.\n\n## Specific Notes ##\n\n### participants.tsv File ###\nSubject ID list and subject-level variables. Please refer to the\nparticipants.json for guidance on how to interpret specific \ncolumns in the participants.tsv file.\n\n### BIDS dataset ###\nData were converted from DICOM source files using dcm2niix. The\nparameters were further extracted from the DICOM files using pydicom\nand converted to .json format. SeriesDates were anonymized and\nshifted to pre-1900's years and a subject-based offset added to\nthe month/year that preserves time difference between initial\nand follow-up visit.\n\nT1- and T2-anatomical scans (anat/*_T{1,2}w.nii.gz) were defaced using \nthe pydeface.py software: \n  https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface (c1ceeb2)\n\n### derivatives Folder ###\nThis folder contains the processed output from the MRIQC protocol.\nMRIQC is an automated processing pipeline designed to compute many\nimage quality metrics for T1 weighted anatomical and T2* weighted\nfunctional scans. For more information please see:\n\n  https://github.com/poldracklab/mriqc (a5f68f5)\n\nAdditional derivatives include:\n\n  - Plots of the fMRI event logs\n  - thumbnail mosaics of the high-resolution T1w and T2w scans used\n    to confirm defacing process.\n\n### sourcedata Folder ###\nThis folder contains the as-provided source files used to create the\nBIDS dataset files. The only changes made to these source files were\nto remove any information that could potentially be used to identify\nthe study participants. Specifically:\n\n  - EyeTrackingLogFiles: Files renamed, \"TimeValues\" and \"TimeStamp\" \n    entries changed to \"REMOVED\" within each file.\n  - PresentationLogFiles: Files renamed, scrubbed of Dates, Subject\n    IDs. These files were used to create the\n       sub-9XXX_ses-{1,2}_task-<taskname>_events.tsv\n    files.\n  - PulseGatingFiles: Files renamed to remove original IDs.\n  - WorkingMemoryTestResults: Files renamed to remove original IDs.,\n    subject IDs altered to 9XXX series randomized IDs. Dates removed.\n    Times-of-day left intact.\n\nOther data that could not be included in raw form due to its binary nature:\n\n  - Physiological recordings (EMG): Converted from raw Acknowledge format\n    to compressed .tsv files using the \"convert_physio_files.py\" script\n    located in the code/ directory within the dataset. The output data are \n    located within the dataset as *_physio.tsv.gz and *_physio.json pairs.\n\n### Diffusion Imaging - use these data with caution ###\nDiffusion imaging from the following subjects should be used with\ncaution due to suspicious bval/bvecs tables extracted from the source\nDICOM files:\n\n    sub-9019  sub-9070  sub-9057  sub-9091  sub-9090  sub-9013  sub-9044\n    sub-9050  sub-9067  sub-9035  sub-9035  sub-9073  sub-9083  sub-9037\n    sub-9007  sub-9053  sub-9066  sub-9012  sub-9082  sub-9077  sub-9076\n    sub-9099  sub-9001\n\n### Raw Polysomnography Data ###\nRaw polysomnography data is available upon request. Please contact Gustav Nilsonne at \ngustav.nilsonne@ki.se to request this data.\n\n### Known Issues ###\n-sub-9066/ses-1/func/sub-9066_ses-1_task-hands_events.tsv does not have all of the columns present in \nthe other events files. It only has 'onset', 'duration' and 'condition'.",

    "description": "﻿Data acquisition methods have been described in detail in Kim et al. (2016, PLoS ONE), but we outline them here and provide file information for clarity and ease of use.\n\n\n\n\n————————————————————————————————Materials\n————————————————————————————————\n\n\nParticipants viewed affect-eliciting audiovisual clips that varied on levels of valence and arousal. Eight stimuli were selected for each affective category corresponding to each of the four quadrants of the affective space: high arousal-negative valence (HN), low arousal-negative valence (LN), low arousal-positive valence (LP), and high arousal-positive valence (HP). \n\n————————————————————————————————\nBOLD fMRI DATA\n————————————————————————————————\nMRI data were acquired on a Siemens Magnetom Trio 3.0T whole-body scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at the McCausland Center for Brain Imaging at the University of South Carolina. The functional images were acquired using a single-shot echo-planar imaging pulse sequence (TR = 2200ms, TE = 35ms, 90° flip angle) with a 12-channel head coil. Thirty-six 3 mm thick oblique-axial slices were imaged in interleaved scanning order with no gap. The acquisition matrix was 64×64 with 3×3×3 mm voxels.  Functional data was acquired using a slow event-related design in two scanning sessions (two runs for each session). High-resolution whole-brain anatomical images were acquired using a standard T1-weighted 3D MP-RAGE protocol (TR= 2250 ms, TE= 4.18 ms, FOV= 256 mm, flip angle= 9°, voxel size=1×1×1 mm) to facilitate normalization of the functional data.  \nData processing and statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB environment using standard procedures in Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM 8, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). The data were corrected for motion and linear trend. Structural data were segmented into white and gray matter to facilitate the normalization. Functional and anatomical images were co-registered and spatially normalized into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space based on T1-derived normalization parameters. \nMain experiment To improve signal-to-noise ratio, the time-series data for each voxel were fit using GLMdenoise, a technique successfully used in MVPA and other applications [54, 55]. GLMdenoise used the four affective categories to estimate regressors of no interest.  Notably the procedure was blind to valence and arousal categories, and thus did not bias the results when comparing across combined categories (i.e., positive versus negative valence or high versus low arousal). Furthermore, to control for possible confounds arising from lower level features of the stimuli, five lower level feature components were regressed out as covariates of no interest together with six head motion parameter estimates. We used principal components to reduce the number of regressors, while keeping most of the variability in the data.The residuals from this analysis were used for all further analyses. The percent signal change (PSC) relative to the average activity in a voxel was computed for each voxel in every volume from the residuals. The mean PSC of two volumes, offset 4.4s from the stimulus onset (to account for the delay in hemodynamic response), was used as the input for further analyses. Data for each condition were standardized across voxels to have zero mean and unit variance. \n \n\n\n\n————————————————————————————————\nFUNCTIONAL LOCALIZER\n————————————————————————————————\n\nAreas responsive to naturalistic audiovisual presentation were identified in a separate localizer session for each participant. There were four experimental conditions: baseline, auditory (beep), dynamic visual (checkerboard), and a combined naturalistic audiovisual condition (audiovisual). Additionally, the functional localizer contained two other conditions that were not part of the present experiment. The conditions were presented in a block design with each block lasting 12s (Fig 2A). Baseline condition consisted of a black screen with a white fixation cross shown in the center of the screen and background noise. During an auditory condition, designed to localize primary auditory cortex, a binaural sine tone of 1,000 Hz pulsating at 6 Hz was presented. During a dynamic visual condition, designed to localize primary visual areas, there were 12s of high-contrast flickering checkerboard reversals, 200ms per cycle. During a naturalistic audiovisual condition, four 3s audiovisual clips sampled from the four affective quadrants were played back to back. There were eight runs in the localizer scan and each run consisted of six conditions presented in a pseudo randomized order such that the same condition was not presented twice in a row for the two subsequent runs. There were a total of 48 blocks resulting in 273 acquired volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n————————————————————————————————\nPUBLICATIONS\n————————————————————————————————\n\n\nJongwan Kim, Jing Wang, Douglas H.

This was the actual \nlength of the events. However, in their models, the authors used a duration equal to one TR \nlength (1.5s).\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure \ndeindentification of subjects. The code\ncan be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface\n\n\nQuality Control\n---------------\nWe are having difficulties running MRIQC and have not included the results in this \nrevision. These should be present in the next revision.\n\nWhere to discuss the dataset\n----------------------------\n1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds******/ See the comments \nsection at the bottom of the dataset\npage.\n2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with \nthe tags openfmri and dsXXXXXX\naccession number.\n3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org. Please \ninclude the dsXXXXXX accession number in\nyour email.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\nThe header information for the functional files conflicts with the information provided in the manuscript (.e.g., the voxel size is 3.2 mm × 3.2 mm × 4 mm in the manuscript but 3.5 mm isotropic in the header). The acquired voxel size was 3.5mm isotropic.\n\nBids-validator Output\n---------------------\n\nThis dataset appears to be BIDS compatible.\n        Summary:                Available Tasks:        Available Modalities:\n        89 Files, 1.57GB        Stroop Task             T1w\n        28 - Subjects                                   bold\n        1 - Session",

    "description": "Participants\nTwenty people with borderline personality disorder were recruited from outpatient and support \nservices from around Edinburgh, Scotland. Diagnoses were confirmed using the Structured Clinical \nInterview for DSM-IV (SCID-II). Current symptoms were assessed using the Zanarini Rating Scale \nfor Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD [1]). Adverse childhood events were assessed using \nthe Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ [2]). Fifteen BPD participants were receiving antidepressant \nmedication and twelve were taking antipsychotic medication. Twenty age- and sex-matched controls \nwere recruited from the community, however four were excluded due to technical issues during \nscanning, leaving sixteen controls. Exclusion criteria for all participants included pregnancy, \nMRI contraindications, diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, previous head injury or current \nillicit substance dependence. Controls met the additional criteria of no personal or familial \nhistory of major mental illness. Ethical approval was obtained from the Lothian National \nHealth Service Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed \nconsent before taking part. \n\nExperimental task\nParticipants performed the Cyberball social exclusion task [3] during functional magnetic \nresonance imaging (fMRI), adapted from a previous implementation by Kumar et al 2009 [4]. \nThe task involves playing “catch” with two computer-controlled players, during which the \nparticipant can be systematically included or excluded from the game.  We used this task as \nit assesses neural responses to social exclusion, is known to activate a range of social \nbrain regions [5] and is amenable to reinforcement learning modelling [4]. The task was \nmodified such that inclusion was varied parametrically over four levels: 0%, 33%, 66% and \n100%, achieved by arranging the task into blocks of nine throws, respectively involving zero, \none, two or three throws to the participant. Here, 100% inclusion means the degree to which \nthe participant was included was equal to that of the other two players, with each receiving \nthree throws per nine-throw block. Participants were asked to imagine that the other players \nwere real, as exclusion by both human or simulated players has been previously reported to \nbe similarly distressing [6-8]. When the participant received the ball, they indicated which \ncomputer player they wished to throw the ball to with a button press. There were four \nrepetitions of each inclusion level, providing 16 experimental blocks in total, with the \nfirst block being 100% inclusion, and all subsequent blocks being randomised. Each throwing \nevent had a mean duration of 2700ms, with each being preceded by randomised jitter that was \nin part adjusted to accommodate the participant’s reaction time from the previous trial, \nwhen applicable. This was achieved by comparing the total duration of the previous trial, \nincluding reaction time, with the ideal trial time of 2700ms: if this value was exceeded, \na random jitter between 0 and 1000ms was subtracted from the mean jitter time of 1500ms; \notherwise, the random jitter was added to 1500ms. Jitter therefore varied between 500ms and \n2500ms. Mean block duration was 24s, with onsets denoted by the appearance of the cartoon \nfigures following rest, and offsets by the conclusion of the final throw animation. Blocks \nwere randomized, and interleaved with 13s rest blocks. Within blocks, throwing events were \njittered to permit event disambiguation for reinforcement learning analysis. \n\nNeuroimaging\nScanning took place at the Clinical Research Imaging Centre in Edinburgh, using a 3T Siemens \nMagnetom Verio scanner. Echo Planar Blood Oxygen Level Dependent images were acquired axially \nwith a TR 1560ms, TE 26ms, flip angle 66’, field of view 220 x 220mm, in-plane resolution \n64 x 64, 26 interleaved slices, 347 volumes, resolution 3.4 x 3.4 x 5mm. A high resolution \nT1 MPRAGE structural image was acquired with TR 2300ms, TE 2.98ms, flip angle 90’, field of \nview 256 x 256mm, in-plane resolution 256 x 256, 160 interleaved slices, resolution 1 x 1 x 1mm. \n\nReferences\n1 Zanarini MC, Vujanovic AA, Parachini EA, Boulanger JL, Frankenburg FR, Hennen J.

The code can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface\n- Pydeface removed part of brain from the anatomical images for sub-02 and sub-11. Thus, defacing\n was performed using mri_deface instead on these images. Information about mri_deface can be found \nhere: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_deface\n\nQuality Control\n---------------\nMriqc output was not run on this dataset due to issues we are having with the software.

    "description": "This dataset contains resting state data collected using a multiband, multiecho simultaneous pseudocontinous ASL (pCASL) and BOLD acquisition. Additional information regarding the sequence is as follows:\n\nThe sequence consists of an unbalanced pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) tagging module, followed by a post labeling delay period (PLD). Following the PLD, a multiband excitation and multi-echo, gradient-echo EPI readout was implemented. Blipped-CAIPI was also applied to reduce g-factor noise amplification caused by the slice-unaliasing in MB imaging. Each echo in the multi-echo acquisition was obtained consecutively as part of one shot. The last repetition is the M0 image collected for quantification of CBF.\nEach subject underwent one resting-state MBME ASL/BOLD scan, which utilized an unbalanced pCASL labeling scheme with labeling time=1.5 s and PLD=1.0 s. A partial k-space acquisition was employed with 20 overscan lines. To keep the later TEs within reasonable ranges and reduce total readout time, in-plane acceleration was employed with R=2. Additional parameters for the MBME ASL/BOLD run were as follows: number of echoes=4, TE=9.1, 25, 39.6, 54.3 ms, TR=3.5 s, MB-factor=4, number of excitations=9 (total slices=9×4=36), FOV=240 mm, resolution=3×3×3 mm, FA=90°, RF pulse width=6400 ms. Scans lasted 644 seconds resulting in 167 acquisitions excluding calibration reps. Subjects were instructed to lie awake with their eyes closed.\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects.

More is meaningful: The magnitude effect in intertemporal choice depends on self-control.

Images with swapped phase encoding for field map correction with topup were only collected from one of the sites. The JSON data for each nifi file explains the parameters used at that site.\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\nSlice acquisition order was interleaved Bottom/UP for both sites.\nSite 1: sub-01 through sub-06\nSite 2: sub-07 through sub-19\n\nWe collected data from two different sites. The first set were collected on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Allegra scanner located at Princeton University. The second set were collected on a 3.0 Tesla GE Discovery scanner located at the Banner Alzheimer Institute (BAI) in Phoenix, Arizona. High-resolution T1-weighted images were first acquired (Princeton: 1Ã—1Ã—1 mm resolution, BAI: .9Ã—.9Ã—.9 mm resolution, MP-RAGE sequence). Whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) weighted echo-planar images were acquired using an interleaved acquisition (TR = 2000 ms; TE=30 ms; flip angle=90Â° (Princeton) 77.2Â° (BAI), slices: 30 total, 4mm thickness (Princeton), 36 total, 3.4 mm thickness (BAI); FOV: 192 mm (Princeton), 222 mm (BAI) matrix = 64Ã—64 (Princeton), 74x74 (BAI), prescription: 30Â° (Princeton) or 0Â° (BAI) off the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line). The data sets were acquired several years apart and differences arose from an evolving understanding of the best parameters for acquiring fMRI data.\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects. The code\ncan be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface\n\nQuality Control\n---------------\nMriqc was run on the dataset. Results are located in derivatives/mriqc. Learn more about it here: https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nWhere to discuss the dataset\n----------------------------\n1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds000223/ See the comments section at the bottom of the dataset\npage.\n2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with the tags openfmri and ds000223\naccession number.\n3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org. Please include the ds000223 accession number in\nyour email.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n- Only the subjects from one of the sites have field map data hence for few subjects fieldmap data is missing\n- Several parameters are not the same across the sites\n- Warning: some of NIFTI files included in this dataset are missing orientation information (sform and qform). Distinguishing between left and right might not be possible. We are looking into fixing this issue. More information can be found here: https://openfmri.org/dataset-orientation-issues/\n\nBids-validator Output\n---------------------\n\n\n1: sform_code and qform_code in the image header are 0.

    "description": "The MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body dataset contains MRI and behavioral data from 318 participants. Datasets for all participants include at least a structural quantitative T1-weighted image and a single 15-minute eyes-open resting-state fMRI session.\n \nThe participants took part in one or two extended protocols: Leipzig Mind-Body-Brain Interactions (LEMON) and Neuroanatomy & Connectivity Protocol (N&C). The data from LEMON protocol is included in the ‘ses-01’ subfolder; the data from N&C protocol in ‘ses-02’ subfolder.\n\nLEMON focuses on structural imaging. 228 participants were scanned.  In addition to the quantitative T1-weighted image, the participants also have a structural T2-weighted image (226 participants), a diffusion-weighted image with 64 directions (228) and a 15-minute eyes-open resting-state session (228). New imaging sequences were introduced into the LEMON protocol after data acquisition for approximately 110 participants. Before the change, a low-resolution 2D FLAIR images were acquired for clinical purposes (110). After the change, 2D FLAIR was replaced with high-resolution 3D FLAIR (117). The second addition was the acquisition of gradient-echo images (112) that can be used for Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging (SWI) and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM). \n\nThe N&C protocol focuses on resting-state fMRI data. 199 participants were scanned with this protocol; 109 participants also took part in the LEMON protocol. Structural data was not acquired for the overlapping LEMON participants. For the unique N&C participants, only a T1-weighted and a low-resolution FLAIR image were acquired. Four 15-minute runs of eyes-open resting-state are the main component of N&C; they are complete for 194 participants, three participants have 3 runs, one participant has 2 runs and one participant has a single run. Due to a bug in multiband sequence used in this protocol, the echo time for N&C resting-state is longer than in LEMON — 39.4 ms vs 30 ms. \n\nForty-five participants have complete imaging data: quantitative T1-weighted, T2-weighted, high-resolution 3D FLAIR, DWI, GRE and 75 minutes of resting-state. Both gradient-echo and spin-echo field maps are available in both datasets for all EPI-based sequences (rsfMRI and DWI). \n\nExtensive behavioral data was acquired in both protocols. They include trait and state questionnaires, as well as behavioral tasks. Here we only list the tasks; more extenstive descriptions are available in the manuscripts.\n\n# LEMON QUESTIONNAIRES/TASKS [not yet released]\n\nCalifornia Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)\nTestbatterie zur Aufmerksamkeitsprüfung (TAP Alertness, Incompatibility, Working Memory)\nTrail Marking Test (TMT)\nWortschatztest (WST)\nLeistungsprüfungssystem 2 (LPS-2)\nRegensburger Wortflüssigkeitstest (RWT)\n\nNEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI)\nImpulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS)\nBehavioral Inhibition and Approach System (BISBAS)\nCognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ)\nMeasure of Affective Style (MARS)\nFragebogen zur Sozialen Unterstützung (F-SozU K)\nThe Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)\nCoping Orientations to Problems Experienced (COPE)\nLife Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R)\nPerceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ)\nthe Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress (TICS)\nThe three-factor eating questionnaire (TFEQ)\nYale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS)\nThe Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue-SF)\nTrait Scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)\nState-Trait Anger expression Inventory (STAXI)\nToronto-Alexithymia Scale (TAS)\nMultidimensional Mood Questionnaire (MDMQ)\nNew York Cognition Questionnaire (NYC-Q)\n\n# N&C QUESTIONNAIRES\nAdult Self Report (ASR)\nGoldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI)\nInternet Addiction Test (IAT)\nInvoluntary Musical Imagery Scale (IMIS)\nMulti-Gender Identity Questionnaire (MGIQ)\nBrief Self-Control Scale (SCS)\nShort Dark Triad (SD3)\nSocial Desirability Scale-17 (SDS)\nSelf-Esteem Scale (SE)\nTuckman Procrastination Scale (TPS)\nVarieties of Inner Speech (VISQ)\nUPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS-P)\nAttention Control Scale (ACS)\nBeck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI)\nBoredom Proneness Scale (BP)\nEsworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)\nMultimedia Multitasking Index (MMI)\nMobile Phone Usage (MPU)\nPersonality Style and Disorder Inventory (PSSI)\nSpontaneous and Deliberate Mind-Wandering (S-D-MW)\nShort New York Cognition Scale (Short-NYC-Q)\nNew York Cognition Scale (NYC-Q)\nAbbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS)\nBehavioral Inhibition and Approach System (BIS/BAS)\nNEO Personality Inventory Revised (NEO-PI-R)\nBody Consciousness Questionnaire (BCQ)\nCreative achievement questionnaire (CAQ)\nFive facets of mindfulness (FFMQ)\nMetacognition (MCQ-30)\n\n# N&C TASKS\nConjunctive continuous performance task (CCPT)\nEmotional task switching (ETS)\nAdaptive visual and auditory oddball target detection task (Oddball)\nAlternative uses task (AUT)\nRemote associates test (RAT)\nSynesthesia color picker test (SYN)\nTest of creative imagery abilities (TCIA)\n\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects.

    "description": "Data acquisition methods have been described in detail in Veldhuizen et al. (under revision) xxx and de Araujo, I. E., Lin, T., Veldhuizen, M. G. & Small, D. M. Metabolic regulation of brain response to food cues. Current biology : CB 23, 878-883, doi:10.1016/j.cub.2013.04.001 (2013).\n\nSubjects\nFifteen healthy weight right-handed subjects (seven female, mean age 23.9 � standard deviation (sd) of 3.5 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 22.4 � 1.4 kg/m2, range 19.2-24.4 kg/m2) consented to our study that was approved by Yale University School of Medicine Human Investigation Committee. All subjects reported having no known taste, smell, neurological, or psychiatric disorders. \n\nPre-Conditioning Session\nStimuli\nStimuli were ten differently flavored non-caloric beverages, contained 0.1% (w/v) citric and 0.0078% sucralose (Sigma-Aldrich Inc. MO, USA) dissolved in demineralized water. The beverages also each had a flavor and a color that were assigned in a counterbalanced manner prior to the pretest, such that there was no consistent flavor-color pairing across subjects (flavor-color pairing was kept constant for each subject across sessions). The flavors used were 0.002% acerola, 0.5% bilberry, 0.1% horchata, 0.1% lulo, 0.2% yuzu. 0.1% papaya, 0.1% chamomile, 0.1% aloe vera, 0.1% mamey, and 0.2% maqui berry (Bell Labs Flavors and Fragrances Inc., IL, USA, product numbers: 33.81940, 15.80182, 132.81478, 141.14606. 101.29478, 102.82506, 141.31243, 141.31480, 46.29969 and 13.32059). The flavors are relatively novel and absent of gustatory or trigeminal components. Food coloring (McCormick & Co, Inc., MD, USA) was used to make the beverages pink, yellow, green, blue, purple, red, orange, teal, yellow-green or indigo. Pilot testing with the in-lab formulated beverages showed that they were near neutral and similarly liked (data not shown). For the maltodextrin triangle test we randomly selected a SoBe lifewater (�mango melon�, �black and blueberry�, �yumberry pomegranate�, �acai fruit punch� or �Fuji apple pear� from PepsiCo, NY, USA) that contained <5 calories. The lifewater was mixed with maltodextrin (Spectrum, CA, USA) at 34% (w/v), equivalent to 150 calories in 355 ml. Since water activates taste cortex  (Frey and Petrides 1999, Zald and Pardo 2000) and has a taste (Bartoshuk, McBurney et al. 1964), we used �artificial saliva� as a flavorless control stimulus and rinse for the fMRI scan (Veldhuizen, Bender et al. 2007). Stimuli in the pretest phase were all presented as 10 ml aliquots in 30 ml medicine cups. Demineralized water was available for rinsing between stimuli.\nProcedure\nSubjects were instructed not to eat or drink anything except water for four hours prior to each session since conditioning has been shown to be stronger when hungry (Mobini, Chambers et al. 2007).  Upon arrival we used a Q-tip to swab the subject�s cheek and told them that this would allow us to detect whether she/he had fasted as instructed. These samples were not actually assayed, but were intended to encourage compliance. Each subject was asked to indicate her/his internal state by rating how hungry, full, and thirsty she/he was, on VAS scales that recorded responses from 0 (e.g. �Not Hungry At all�) to 100 (e.g. �Very Hungry�), a recurring set of ratings that we will refer to as �internal state ratings� from here on. The control solution was then selected by presenting the dilution series of artificial saliva pairwise in a two alternative-forced-choice procedure in which the subject indicated �which of these two solutions tastes most like nothing?� The subject was next trained to make ratings using the general labeled magnitude scale (gLMS) for intensity ratings (Green, Dalton et al. 1996, Bartoshuk, Duffy et al. 2004) and the labeled hedonic scale (LHS) for liking ratings (Lim, Wood et al. 2009).\nIn order to familiarize the subject with the stimuli, the ten different beverages were first presented (once each) without requiring the subject to make any ratings. The subject was instructed to take the solution entirely into her/his mouth, swish it around, and expectorate into a sink. The subject then rinsed and paused for 30 seconds before continuing to the next sample. Next, utilizing the same sip-and-spit procedure the ten different beverages were each presented three times (counterbalanced pseudo-random orders), but before rinsing the subject was instructed to rate the stimulus for overall intensity, sweetness intensity, liking and wanting. Wanting was measured with a VAS with the labels �I would never want to drink this� at the left anchor, �neutral� in the middle and �I would want to drink this more than anything� on the right anchor). The presentation order of the scales was counterbalanced across subjects. Averages were obtained for each flavor rating. The averaged liking ratings were evaluated to determine if a subset of five flavors was rated above �neutral� (0) but below �like moderately� (17.82) on the LHS. The five flavors were also required to be similarly liked, for which there needed to be overlap between standard deviations of the averaged liking ratings. If such a subset of flavors could be determined, the subject continued in the pre-conditioning session (and the subset of five eligible flavors became that subject�s �conditioning� flavors for the exposure phase). If not, the subject was excluded from further participation. Approximately 40% of subjects were excluded for this reason, but we felt that it was justified so that we could rule out baseline liking ratings as contributing to the predicted increases in liking resulting from conditioning. \nTo verify that study participants could not detect the presence of maltodextrin (purportedly a tasteless and odorless carbohydrate) in the exposure phase of the experiment, they participated in a triangle test in which they indicated which of three cups was different. All cups contained the same flavor, but for each trial, either one or two cups also contained maltodextrin. Eight trials were conducted. We used the binomial distribution to set our criteria for maltodextrin detection; specifically, the minimum number of correct judgments to establish significance for the triangle test (one-tailed, a = 0.05, z = 1.64, probability of guessing p = 1/3) was calculated according to the formula\n  \nwhere n = number of trials, X = minimum number of correct judgments, and z = 1.64 if a is set to 5% (Lawless and Heymann 1999). Therefore, for n = 8 tests, the minimum number of correct judgments X=6. \nFollowing this the subject participated in a training session in the fMRI simulator, in order to familiarize the individual with the task and to confirm they were comfortable with all aspects of the fMRI experimental procedure (no subject reported experiencing discomfort with the procedure). For the training, the subject underwent one full 13-minute run in the fMRI simulator. Briefly, while lying supine in an fMRI simulator, we presented 1ml aliquots Sobe Lifewaters (mango melon and black and blueberry), and a photo of a PET-bottle containing the Sobe Lifewater. \n\nExposure phase\nStimuli \nBased on the subject�s liking of the ten flavors, a subset of five were selected to be paired with the five caloric doses, and consumed by the subjects during the exposure sessions. Each of these flavors was paired with a specific nutrient dose by adding maltodextrin at five different increments (0, 37.5, 75, 112.5, or 150 calories), with the highest dose equivalent to a standard 12 fl oz (355 ml) can of soda. We created a total of six 355 ml beverages for each flavor-nutrient load combination, in PET-bottles. Beverage flavor, color, caloric load, and presentation order were all counterbalanced and mixed by one of the authors (MGV) who was not in contact with the subject during the exposure sessions. The beverages were not labeled for their caloric content at any time. Thus the conditioning phase of this study was double-blind.\nProcedure \nThere were a total of ten exposure days, divided into five sets of two consecutive days. During each set of two exposure days one of the five selected in-lab beverages (with its specific caloric load) was consumed on six different occasions following the 36 hours after the first in-lab exposures to that beverage. Subjects were encouraged to consume the same breakfast at the same time during all exposure days. During the first exposure day, the subject came to the lab for a lunch session, which was scheduled to take place 30 minutes before the subject�s normal lunch time and at least four hours after their normal breakfast time. The session began with a cheek swab, completion of a food diary on the content and time of their breakfast that morning, and rating their internal state (see above). Following their ratings, the subject consumed the beverage at their own pace. Immediately after the drink the subject made another set of internal state ratings, relaxed for 30 minutes, and then again rated their internal state. Subsequently, they were provided with a lunch (of their choice, but fixed across lunch sessions) that they consumed in the lab before rating their internal state one final time. The subject returned to the lab four hours later for their dinner session having not consumed anything (but water) between sessions. The dinner session followed the same procedure as the lunch session, except that the dinner session ended with the ratings made after the 30 minute wait, at which time the subject was instructed to eat dinner autonomously outside the lab. Previous work (Appleton, Gentry et al. 2006) has shown that FNL also occurs for stimuli consumed outside a lab setting, so in order to maximize the number of exposures subjects were given another four bottles (of the same beverage). Subjects were instructed to consume their four beverages at four different time points between that evening and the following evening: 1) one hour after dinner, 2) one hour before lunch the next day, 3) one hour before dinner the next day, and 4) one hour after dinner the next day. To encourage compliance subjects signed a sheet stating that they adhered to the instructions to the best of their ability, and returned the empty bottles to the lab. All subjects complied with these instructions. The five sets of exposure days were all completed within a two week period.\n\nPost-conditioning session\nThe same stimuli and procedures from pretest were used to collect ratings for the ten beverages (without calories added) at a post-conditioning session that occurred before the fMRI scan. \n\nfMRI scan \nStimuli and stimulus delivery\nThe subjects� five exposure beverages (without calories added) were used during the fMRI session, and the flavorless solution was used as both the rinse and a control stimulus. The subject�s exposure flavors and selected tasteless solution were delivered as 1mL of solution over 4 s from syringe pumps with a gustometer system that has previously been described in detail (Veldhuizen, Bender et al. 2007). In brief, this system consists of computer-controlled syringe pumps which infuse liquids from syringes filled with flavor solutions into an fMRI-compatible custom designed gustatory manifold via 25-foot lengths of Tygon beverage tubing (Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, Akron, OH, USA). The gustatory manifold is mounted on the MRI headcoil and the tubes anchor into separate channels that converge over a stylus, which rests just inside the subject�s mouth. When a pump is triggered liquid drops from the channel onto the stylus and comes in contact with the tongue. \nExperimental Design\nDuring the fMRI scanning session, the subject performed one anatomical run and a total of three functional runs, each 13 minutes long. A long event-related design was used (for details of events within each trial see Fig. 1). During each of the runs, each flavor that was selected for the exposure sessions as well as the flavorless control was presented six times in a pseudo-random order, resulting in a total of eighteen repeats for each stimulus.  \nfMRI Data Acquisition\nWe measure the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal as an indication of cerebral brain activation with echo planar imaging, acquired on a Siemens 3T TIM Trio scanner. Echo planar imaging was used to measure the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal as an indication of cerebral brain activation. A susceptibility-weighted single-shot echo planar method was used to image the regional distribution of the BOLD signal with parameters of: TR: 2000ms; TE: 20 ms; flip angle: 90�; FOV: 220 mm; matrix: 64 x 64; slice thickness: 3 mm, and number of slices: 40. Slices were acquired in an interleaved mode to reduce the crosstalk of the slice selection pulse. At the beginning of each functional run, the MR signal was allowed to equilibrate over six scans for a total of 12 s, which were then excluded from analysis. The anatomical scan used a T1-weighted 3D FLASH sequence (TR/TE: 2530/3.66 ms; flip angle: 20�; FOV: 256; matrix: 256 x 256; slice thickness: 1 mm; number of slices: 176).\n\nDebriefing\nImmediately after the fMRI scan the subject was debriefed about the goal of the study, the manipulation with the caloric dose of the beverages, and saliva collection. None of the subjects professed any awareness of the manipulation.",

    "description": "Description of the ASL sequence\nA sequence with pseudo-continuous labeling, background suppression and 3D RARE Stack-Of-Spirals readout with optional through-plane acceleration was implemented for this study. At the beginning of the sequence, gradients were rapidly played with alternating polarity to correct for their delay in the spiral trajectories, followed by two preparation TRs, to allow the signal to reach the steady state. A non-accelerated readout was played during the preparation TRs, in order to obtain a fully sampled k-space dataset, used for calibration of the parallel imaging reconstruction kernel, needed to reconstruct the skipped kz partitions in the accelerated images.\n\nDescription of study\nPerfusion data were acquired on an elderly cohort using the single-shot, accelerated sequence.\nFor each participant, first a high-resolution anatomical T1-weighted image was acquired with a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence.\nResting perfusion data were acquired with a 1-shot 1D-accelerated readout for a total scan duration of 5 min, with labeling and PLD times of 1.5 and 1.5 s. Two M0 images with long TR and no magnetization preparation were acquired per run for CBF quantification purposes.\n\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects.

    "description": "Data acquisition methods have been described in detail in Veldhuizen et al. (under revision) xxx and de Araujo, I. E., Lin, T., Veldhuizen, M. G. & Small, D. M. Metabolic regulation of brain response to food cues. Current biology : CB 23, 878-883, doi:10.1016/j.cub.2013.04.001 (2013).\n\n9 healthy, normal weight (BMI 21.4 � 0.5) participants age 24.5 � 2.0 (7 women) were recruited from the New Haven area. Participants completed a preconditioning session using the same stimuli and procedure described in study 1, except that only 4 flavors were required to be similarly liked. After exposure sessions (described below) there was a post-conditioning session (as in Study 1) and fMRI scan (described below). \n\nCalorimetry Sessions\nParticipants arrived at the lab at the same time each day (between 10 am and 2 pm) neither hungry nor full, having consumed only water for 4 hours prior to arrival.  Resting energy expenditure  (REE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured with a TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Measurement System (ParvoMedics, Inc., Sandy, Utah) for at least 15 minutes before and for at least 30 minutes immediately after consumption of a 355 ml-beverage. Beverages contained 0, 112.5, or 150 kilocalories provided by maltodextrin, and were presented in a randomized crossover design on separate days. Beverage color and flavor were randomly selected from those described in study 1 and remained constant for each participant across caloric dose.\n\nExposure Phase\nExposure phase stimuli were prepared as described in study 1, except that we used 3 caloric loads rather than 5 (0, 112.5, and 150 kcal). Participants were exposed to 3 beverages (each containing a different load) a total of 6 times, as described above. Indirect calorimetry was performed on one afternoon session and blood draws were performed on the other.  \n\nBlood Draw Session\nIn order to determine the influence of beverage consumption on plasma glucose blood samples were collected at one of the lunch exposure sessions for each beverage. The IV was inserted after the cheek swab sample was collected. After IV insertion, participants waited 30 minutes to stabilize before the blood was drawn prior to drink consumption. A second blood sample was taken 30 minutes after the beverage consumption and the IV was removed (before lunch). The blood samples were immediately spun down and glucose, insulin, ghrelin, triglycerides, hematocrit and hemoglobin assayed. A small aliquot of whole blood (~0.3ml) was used for the immediate analyses of hematocrit and hemoglobin. Another aliquot was transferred into a tube with potassium EDTA anticoagulant for the determination of ghrelin. The remaining sample was transferred into a tube with no anticoagulant for the determination of blood insulin, glucose and triglycerides. The samples were centrifuged, frozen immediately and stored at �80�C until analysis. Serum concentration of insulin and plasma concentration of ghrelin was measured using the competitive binding radioimmunoassay method. Intra and inter assay coefficient of variation for the mid-range standard for insulin [45 (4.5) uIU/ml] was 2.3% and 3.7% (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Los Angeles, CA). Intra and inter assay coefficients of variation for ghrelin (standards low range 418-868 pg/mL) were 1.6% and 2.9% (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Plasma glucose and triglycerides were measured using the modified Trinder method through a colorimetric endpoint (Eagle Diagnostics, DeSoto, TX). Whole blood hemoglobin is also a colorimetric assay based on the determination of cyanmethemoglobin (Eagle Diagnostics, DeSoto, TX). Hematocrit is measured by drawing up whole blood into heparinized hematocrit tubes and centrifuged for 3 minutes. The percentage of red blood cells vs. plasma is read on a micro-capillary plate.\n\nfMRI Scan\nStimuli, Design, and Data Acquisition\nStimulus delivery, study design, and data acquisition were the same as in study 1 with the following exceptions:  Participants only received 4 non-caloric beverages during scanning (the three exposed flavors 0, 112.5, and 150 kcal and the unexposed control). Each stimulus was delivered 21 times over three 12-min 38-sec functional runs.\n\n\nPre-Conditioning Session\nStimuli\nStimuli were ten differently flavored non-caloric beverages, contained 0.1% (w/v) citric and 0.0078% sucralose (Sigma-Aldrich Inc. MO, USA) dissolved in demineralized water. The beverages also each had a flavor and a color that were assigned in a counterbalanced manner prior to the pretest, such that there was no consistent flavor-color pairing across subjects (flavor-color pairing was kept constant for each subject across sessions). The flavors used were 0.002% acerola, 0.5% bilberry, 0.1% horchata, 0.1% lulo, 0.2% yuzu. 0.1% papaya, 0.1% chamomile, 0.1% aloe vera, 0.1% mamey, and 0.2% maqui berry (Bell Labs Flavors and Fragrances Inc., IL, USA, product numbers: 33.81940, 15.80182, 132.81478, 141.14606. 101.29478, 102.82506, 141.31243, 141.31480, 46.29969 and 13.32059). The flavors are relatively novel and absent of gustatory or trigeminal components. Food coloring (McCormick & Co, Inc., MD, USA) was used to make the beverages pink, yellow, green, blue, purple, red, orange, teal, yellow-green or indigo. Pilot testing with the in-lab formulated beverages showed that they were near neutral and similarly liked (data not shown). For the maltodextrin triangle test we randomly selected a SoBe lifewater (�mango melon�, �black and blueberry�, �yumberry pomegranate�, �acai fruit punch� or �Fuji apple pear� from PepsiCo, NY, USA) that contained <5 calories. The lifewater was mixed with maltodextrin (Spectrum, CA, USA) at 34% (w/v), equivalent to 150 calories in 355 ml. Since water activates taste cortex  (Frey and Petrides 1999, Zald and Pardo 2000) and has a taste (Bartoshuk, McBurney et al. 1964), we used �artificial saliva� as a flavorless control stimulus and rinse for the fMRI scan (Veldhuizen, Bender et al. 2007). Stimuli in the pretest phase were all presented as 10 ml aliquots in 30 ml medicine cups. Demineralized water was available for rinsing between stimuli.\nProcedure\nSubjects were instructed not to eat or drink anything except water for four hours prior to each session since conditioning has been shown to be stronger when hungry (Mobini, Chambers et al. 2007).  Upon arrival we used a Q-tip to swab the subject�s cheek and told them that this would allow us to detect whether she/he had fasted as instructed. These samples were not actually assayed, but were intended to encourage compliance. Each subject was asked to indicate her/his internal state by rating how hungry, full, and thirsty she/he was, on VAS scales that recorded responses from 0 (e.g. �Not Hungry At all�) to 100 (e.g. �Very Hungry�), a recurring set of ratings that we will refer to as �internal state ratings� from here on. The control solution was then selected by presenting the dilution series of artificial saliva pairwise in a two alternative-forced-choice procedure in which the subject indicated �which of these two solutions tastes most like nothing?� The subject was next trained to make ratings using the general labeled magnitude scale (gLMS) for intensity ratings (Green, Dalton et al. 1996, Bartoshuk, Duffy et al. 2004) and the labeled hedonic scale (LHS) for liking ratings (Lim, Wood et al. 2009).\nIn order to familiarize the subject with the stimuli, the ten different beverages were first presented (once each) without requiring the subject to make any ratings. The subject was instructed to take the solution entirely into her/his mouth, swish it around, and expectorate into a sink. The subject then rinsed and paused for 30 seconds before continuing to the next sample. Next, utilizing the same sip-and-spit procedure the ten different beverages were each presented three times (counterbalanced pseudo-random orders), but before rinsing the subject was instructed to rate the stimulus for overall intensity, sweetness intensity, liking and wanting. Wanting was measured with a VAS with the labels �I would never want to drink this� at the left anchor, �neutral� in the middle and �I would want to drink this more than anything� on the right anchor). The presentation order of the scales was counterbalanced across subjects. Averages were obtained for each flavor rating. The averaged liking ratings were evaluated to determine if a subset of five flavors was rated above �neutral� (0) but below �like moderately� (17.82) on the LHS. The five flavors were also required to be similarly liked, for which there needed to be overlap between standard deviations of the averaged liking ratings. If such a subset of flavors could be determined, the subject continued in the pre-conditioning session (and the subset of five eligible flavors became that subject�s �conditioning� flavors for the exposure phase). If not, the subject was excluded from further participation. Approximately 40% of subjects were excluded for this reason, but we felt that it was justified so that we could rule out baseline liking ratings as contributing to the predicted increases in liking resulting from conditioning. \nTo verify that study participants could not detect the presence of maltodextrin (purportedly a tasteless and odorless carbohydrate) in the exposure phase of the experiment, they participated in a triangle test in which they indicated which of three cups was different. All cups contained the same flavor, but for each trial, either one or two cups also contained maltodextrin. Eight trials were conducted. We used the binomial distribution to set our criteria for maltodextrin detection; specifically, the minimum number of correct judgments to establish significance for the triangle test (one-tailed, a = 0.05, z = 1.64, probability of guessing p = 1/3) was calculated according to the formula\n  \nwhere n = number of trials, X = minimum number of correct judgments, and z = 1.64 if a is set to 5% (Lawless and Heymann 1999). Therefore, for n = 8 tests, the minimum number of correct judgments X=6. \nFollowing this the subject participated in a training session in the fMRI simulator, in order to familiarize the individual with the task and to confirm they were comfortable with all aspects of the fMRI experimental procedure (no subject reported experiencing discomfort with the procedure). For the training, the subject underwent one full 13-minute run in the fMRI simulator. Briefly, while lying supine in an fMRI simulator, we presented 1ml aliquots Sobe Lifewaters (mango melon and black and blueberry), and a photo of a PET-bottle containing the Sobe Lifewater. \n\nExposure phase\nStimuli \nBased on the subject�s liking of the ten flavors, a subset of five were selected to be paired with the five caloric doses, and consumed by the subjects during the exposure sessions. Each of these flavors was paired with a specific nutrient dose by adding maltodextrin at five different increments (0, 37.5, 75, 112.5, or 150 calories), with the highest dose equivalent to a standard 12 fl oz (355 ml) can of soda. We created a total of six 355 ml beverages for each flavor-nutrient load combination, in PET-bottles. Beverage flavor, color, caloric load, and presentation order were all counterbalanced and mixed by one of the authors (MGV) who was not in contact with the subject during the exposure sessions. The beverages were not labeled for their caloric content at any time. Thus the conditioning phase of this study was double-blind.\nProcedure \nThere were a total of ten exposure days, divided into five sets of two consecutive days. During each set of two exposure days one of the five selected in-lab beverages (with its specific caloric load) was consumed on six different occasions following the 36 hours after the first in-lab exposures to that beverage. Subjects were encouraged to consume the same breakfast at the same time during all exposure days. During the first exposure day, the subject came to the lab for a lunch session, which was scheduled to take place 30 minutes before the subject�s normal lunch time and at least four hours after their normal breakfast time. The session began with a cheek swab, completion of a food diary on the content and time of their breakfast that morning, and rating their internal state (see above). Following their ratings, the subject consumed the beverage at their own pace. Immediately after the drink the subject made another set of internal state ratings, relaxed for 30 minutes, and then again rated their internal state. Subsequently, they were provided with a lunch (of their choice, but fixed across lunch sessions) that they consumed in the lab before rating their internal state one final time. The subject returned to the lab four hours later for their dinner session having not consumed anything (but water) between sessions. The dinner session followed the same procedure as the lunch session, except that the dinner session ended with the ratings made after the 30 minute wait, at which time the subject was instructed to eat dinner autonomously outside the lab. Previous work (Appleton, Gentry et al. 2006) has shown that FNL also occurs for stimuli consumed outside a lab setting, so in order to maximize the number of exposures subjects were given another four bottles (of the same beverage). Subjects were instructed to consume their four beverages at four different time points between that evening and the following evening: 1) one hour after dinner, 2) one hour before lunch the next day, 3) one hour before dinner the next day, and 4) one hour after dinner the next day. To encourage compliance subjects signed a sheet stating that they adhered to the instructions to the best of their ability, and returned the empty bottles to the lab. All subjects complied with these instructions. The five sets of exposure days were all completed within a two week period.\n\nPost-conditioning session\nThe same stimuli and procedures from pretest were used to collect ratings for the ten beverages (without calories added) at a post-conditioning session that occurred before the fMRI scan. \n\nfMRI scan \nStimuli and stimulus delivery\nThe subjects� five exposure beverages (without calories added) were used during the fMRI session, and the flavorless solution was used as both the rinse and a control stimulus. The subject�s exposure flavors and selected tasteless solution were delivered as 1mL of solution over 4 s from syringe pumps with a gustometer system that has previously been described in detail (Veldhuizen, Bender et al. 2007). In brief, this system consists of computer-controlled syringe pumps which infuse liquids from syringes filled with flavor solutions into an fMRI-compatible custom designed gustatory manifold via 25-foot lengths of Tygon beverage tubing (Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, Akron, OH, USA). The gustatory manifold is mounted on the MRI headcoil and the tubes anchor into separate channels that converge over a stylus, which rests just inside the subject�s mouth. When a pump is triggered liquid drops from the channel onto the stylus and comes in contact with the tongue. \nExperimental Design\nDuring the fMRI scanning session, the subject performed one anatomical run and a total of three functional runs, each 13 minutes long. A long event-related design was used (for details of events within each trial see Fig. 1). During each of the runs, each flavor that was selected for the exposure sessions as well as the flavorless control was presented six times in a pseudo-random order, resulting in a total of eighteen repeats for each stimulus.  \nfMRI Data Acquisition\nWe measure the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal as an indication of cerebral brain activation with echo planar imaging, acquired on a Siemens 3T TIM Trio scanner. Echo planar imaging was used to measure the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal as an indication of cerebral brain activation. A susceptibility-weighted single-shot echo planar method was used to image the regional distribution of the BOLD signal with parameters of: TR: 2000ms; TE: 20 ms; flip angle: 90�; FOV: 220 mm; matrix: 64 x 64; slice thickness: 3 mm, and number of slices: 40. Slices were acquired in an interleaved mode to reduce the crosstalk of the slice selection pulse. At the beginning of each functional run, the MR signal was allowed to equilibrate over six scans for a total of 12 s, which were then excluded from analysis. The anatomical scan used a T1-weighted 3D FLASH sequence (TR/TE: 2530/3.66 ms; flip angle: 20�; FOV: 256; matrix: 256 x 256; slice thickness: 1 mm; number of slices: 176).\n\nDebriefing\nImmediately after the fMRI scan the subject was debriefed about the goal of the study, the manipulation with the caloric dose of the beverages, and saliva collection. None of the subjects professed any awareness of the manipulation.\n\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects.

    "description": "This is a human fMRI dataset that investigates coding of individual faces in the\nvisual cortex of healthy human volunteers. We also include behavioral data from\na similarity judgment task, and computational models that can be used to fit\nboth data modalities.\n\nSee the associated reference (Carlin & Kriegeskorte, in press, PLOS CB) for\ndetails about the experimental protocol. In this README we focus on technical\ndetails that may be useful for re-analysing the data. \n\nThe behavioral and fMRI distance matrices as well as the computational modeling\nefforts have been shared previously at OSF (https://osf.io/5g9rv) and zenodo\n(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.242666), so this may be an easier way to go if\nyou don't want to re-run the entire fMRI preprocessing pipeline. \n\nDICOM TO BIDS CONVERSION\nDCM files were converted to nifti using dcm2niix v1.0.20170130\n(https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix), and dcm2bids\n(https://github.com/jooh/Dcm2Bids).  Anatomical images were de-faced using\npydeface (https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface).\n\nDATA ANALYSIS SETUP\nWe analysed data using Matlab R2013A, SPM, FSL, and various custom software\ndeveloped in Matlab. The following packages (and their associated\ndependencies) are necessary to get the included analysis code to run:\n\n* Automatic Analysis 5 (AA, https://github.com/rhodricusack/automaticanalysis)\n* pilab (https://github.com/jooh/pilab)\n* pilab_aa (https://github.com/jooh/pilab_aa)\n* facedistid_analysis (https://github.com/jooh/facedistid_analysis - an up to\n    date copy is available in the code folder)\n\nIn general, the AA pipeline generates all fMRI results and figures (Figs 1-2,\nS3-S4 Figs in the manuscript). We then extracted fMRI distance matrices from\ncortical regions of interests for further computational modeling (remaining\nfigures in the manuscript).\n\nKEY FILES\nfacedist_aa_frombids.m                  The master function for running the AA\n                                            fMRI analysis pipeline\nfacedist_aa_frombids_tasklist.xml       Specifies which AA modules to run - note\n                                            that the roiroot flag specifies an\n                                            absolute path that will need\n                                            updating for your file system \nfacedist_doit_facepairs                 The master function for running the\n                                            behavioral similarity judgment\n                                            analysis\nfacedist_doit_modeling                  The master function for running the\n                                            computational model fits (you will\n                                            need to run through\n                                            facedist_aa_frombids and\n                                            facedist_doit_facepairs first to\n                                            generate intermediate results)\nderivatives/aa/aap_prov.png             Nice visualisation of fMRI result\n                                            provenance\nderivatives/rois                        ROI masks for fROI analysis (if you want\n                                            to re-define ROIs from the localiser\n                                            data you can do so using\n                                            https://github.com/jooh/roitools/blob/master/spm2roi.m)\nmisc/data_perceptual_judgment_task.mat  data from behavioral similarity judgment\n                                            task\nmisc/stimuli_mri.mat                    video stimuli used during MRI scanning\nmisc/stimuli_perceptual_judgments.mat   video stimuli used during behavioral\n                                            task\n\nA NOTE ON REPRODUCIBILITY\nIf you run the above pipeline you will obtain results that are very similar to\nthose in the manuscript (which, again, are publicly available on OSF/Zenodo),\nbut not identical. This is because of the following differences with regard to\nthe analysis in the paper:\n\n* The paper analysis used SPM8, not 12\n* The paper analysis used SPM dicom conversion, not dcm2niix\n* The paper analysis included a super-extraneous conversion of the floating\n    point precision on the niftis during preprocessing, which did nothing but\n    blow up file size it turns out.\n* The paper analysis used a bastardised version of AA4, not 5, which probably\n    introduces lots of subtle differences in the preprocessing parameters (for\n    this AA version, see\n    https://github.com/jooh/automaticanalysis/tree/v4-master)\n* Lots of other dependencies (including pilab) continued to be developed and\n    improved.\n\nNote that in particular, the ROI masks were generated using the old analysis, so\nthe results could definitely be improved by re-running ROI definition, if\nsomeone has a few days to spare... But again, discrepancies are very small and\ndo not qualitatively change any conclusions made in the paper. Exact\nreproducibility in neuroimaging is hard.  If you want to inspect the AA analysis\nthat is reported in the paper, please get in touch and we will see if there is a\nway to convince the MRC to let you have access to non-anonymous data.\n\nREFERENCE\n\nCarlin, J.D & Kriegeskorte, N.

    "description": "All subjects underwent an MRI resting-state scan. Subjects were instructed to lie still with their eyes open, without falling asleep. Immediately after this scan, they were asked whether they fell asleep, and none of them reported they did.\nThe MRI examination was carried out on a 3T whole-body MRI scanner (Trio TIM), using the body coil as transmitter and a 32-channel phased-array head coil as receiver. The imaging protocol included a 3D high-resolution anatomical T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (with inversion time (TI) = 950 ms, repetition time (TR) = 1760 ms, echo-time (TE) = 3.1 ms, resolution = 1 mm isotropic, scan time = 5:08 min). This sequence was followed by an ASL sequence that combined pseudo-continuous labeling (PCASL) with a background-suppressed 3D GRASE single-shot readout. The labeling parameters were as follows: Hanning-shaped RF pulses, B1average = 1.8 microT, RFduration = 500 micro.sec, spacing = 500 micro.sec, Gaverage = 1mT/m, Gmaximum/Gaverage = 8, labeling duration = 1600 ms, post-labeling delay = 1500 ms. The imaging parameters were as follows: TR = 3.5 sec, TE = 29 msec, resolution = 4x4x7 mm3, FOV = 250x188x112 mm3 , 16 nominal partitions with 12.5% oversampling, 5/8 slice partial Fourier, matrix size = 64x49x11, BW = 2790Hz/pixel, gradient-echo spacing = 0.4 msec (with ramp sampling), spin-echo spacing = 29 msec, read-out time = 270 msec. Details of the background suppression scheme can be found in [1]. 50 pairs of label and control images were acquired in 6 minutes. A short scan of 5 label/control pairs was performed using the same sequence without background suppression to acquire control images needed for calculation of CBF, this 10 images are allocated at the beginning of each ASL sequence, so each subject ASL sequence has 110 images.\n\nReferences:\n1.

    "description": "Overview\n========\nFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has opened the door\nto brain mapping of perceptual, motor, or cognitive functions. As such, it\nprovides an instrumental basis for the whole field of cognitive neuroimag-\ning. However, there exists to date no data collection that systematically\nmaps representations for a wide-variety of mental functions at a fine spa-\ntial scale. The Individual Brain Charting (IBC) project is collecting a\nhigh-resolution multi-task-fMRI dataset, to provide an objective basis for\na comprehensive atlas of brain responses. The data refer to a cohort of\ntwelve participants performing many different tasks. Acquiring a large\namount of tasks on the same subjects yields a precise mapping of the\nunderlying functions, free from both inter-subject and inter-site variabil-\nity. Additionally, the dataset comes with high-resolution anatomical and\ndiffusion images, to achieve a fine anatomical characterization of these\nbrains. \n\n\n\nDataset content overview\n========================\n\nThis is an overview of the dataset content. \n\nMore information and updates are available at http://project.inria.fr/IBC/\n\nThe data in release 1 are organized as follows:\n\n./task*.json: Descritpion of the  tasks used in this release\n./participants.tsv Description of the participants\n./sub-XX subject directories\n./sub-XX/ses-YY session directories\n\nNote that there are many sessions per subject and that the session are\nnumbered according to acquisition date, which yields different actual\nacquisitions depending on the subjects. The data are thus much better\nby the MRI file names, than by session id.\n\nSession directories comprise the following subdirectories:\n* anat/ for T1w-, T2w- and flair image\n* dwi/ for diffusion-weighted data\n* fmap/ for field maps\n* func/ for functional data\n\nNote that diffusion-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR images are not\nmeant to be used for advanced neuroimaging investigations. They were\nacquired to check the absence of conspicuos abnormalities at screening\nstage.  High-resolution anatomical and diffusion-weighted images will\nbe procided in the future.\n\nRegarding functional data, the file naming conventions is\nsub-XX_ses-YY_task-ZZZ_acq-AA_bold.nii.gz,\nwhere\n* XX is the subject id\n* YY is the session id\n* ZZZ is one of the twelve tasks used\n* 'AA' is either ap pa, corresponding to the phase encoding direction\n\nThese fMRI files are provided together with \nsub-XX_ses-YY_task-ZZZ_acq-AA_events.tsv files,\nthat describe the corresponding events.\n\nIn the same folder, the 'ap' and 'pa' variant of a given acquisition\nare always found.  the corresponding fiel maps are available in the\nfmap folder to correct distortions. test-retest or fixed effectsmodels\ncan be computed across the corresponding data after suitable\npreprocessing.\n\n\nMore information and material\n=============================\n\nThe functional protocols used can be dowloaded at:\nhttps://github.com/hbp-brain-charting/public_protocols\n\nAnalysis scripts can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/hbp-brain-charting/public_analysis_code\n\n\nContact\n=======\nBertrand Thirion, bertrand.thirion@inria.fr\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nThe submitter defaced all the T1w anatomical images. We used pydeface to deface the rest of \nthe anatomical images, excluding acq-tse_T2w.nii.gz which did not need to be defaced. The \ncode can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface\n\nQuality Control\n---------------\nMRIQC output could not be included at this time. It will be added to the \nnext revision.\n\nWhere to discuss the dataset\n----------------------------\n1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/ See the comments section at the bottom of the dataset\npage.\n2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with the tags openfmri and ds000244.\n3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org. Please include the accession number in\nyour email.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\npixdim7 for all bold images is very large (ranging from 32406.267578 to 67769.250000)",

    "description": "# DatasetAuditory - Brainstorm\n\n## License\n\nThis dataset (MEG and MRI data) was collected by the MEG Unit Lab, McConnell Brain Imaging Center, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Canada. The original purpose was to serve as a tutorial data example for the Brainstorm software project (http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm). It is presently released in the Public Domain, and is not subject to copyright in any jurisdiction.\n\nWe would appreciate though that you reference this dataset in your publications: please acknowledge its authors (Elizabeth Bock, Peter Donhauser, Francois Tadel and Sylvain Baillet) and cite the Brainstorm project seminal publication (also in open access): \nhttp://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2011/879716/\n \n\n\n## Presentation of the experiment\n\n#### Experiment\n\n* One subject, two acquisition runs of 6 minutes each\n* Subject stimulated binaurally with intra-aural earphones (air tubes+transducers)\n* Each run contains:\n    * 200 regular beeps (440Hz)\n    * 40 easy deviant beeps (554.4Hz, 4 semitones higher)\n* Random inter-stimulus interval: between 0.7s and 1.7s seconds, uniformly distributed\n* The subject presses a button when detecting a deviant with the right index finger\n* Auditory stimuli generated with the Matlab Psychophysics toolbox\n* The specifications of this dataset were discussed initially on [the FieldTrip bug tracker][2]\n\n#### MEG acquisition\n\n* Acquisition at **2400Hz**, with a **CTF 275** system, subject in seating position\n* Recorded at the Montreal Neurological Institute in December 2013\n* Anti-aliasing low-pass filter at 600Hz, files saved with the 3rd order gradient\n* Recorded channels (340):\n    * 1 Stim channel indicating the presentation times of the audio stimuli: UPPT001 (#1)\n    * 1 Audio signal sent to the subject: UADC001 (#316)\n    * 1 Response channel recordings the finger taps in response to the deviants: UDIO001 (#2)\n    * 26 MEG reference sensors (#5-#30)\n    * 274 MEG axial gradiometers (#31-#304)\n    * 2 EEG electrodes: Cz, Pz (#305 and #306)\n    * 1 ECG bipolar (#307)\n    * 2 EOG bipolar (vertical #308, horizontal #309)\n    * 12 Head tracking channels: Nasion XYZ, Left XYZ, Right XYZ, Error N/L/R (#317-#328)\n    * 20 Unused channels (#3, #4, #310-#315, #329-340)\n* 3 datasets:\n    * **S01_AEF_20131218_01.ds**: Run #1, 360s, 200 standard + 40 deviants\n\n    * **S01_AEF_20131218_02.ds**: Run #2, 360s, 200 standard + 40 deviants\n\n    * **S01_Noise_20131218_01.ds**: Empty room recordings, 30s long\n\n    * File name: S01=Subject01, AEF=Auditory evoked field, 20131218=date(Dec 18 2013), 01=run\n* Use of the .ds, not the AUX (standard at the MNI) because they are easier to manipulate in FieldTrip\n\n#### Stimulation delays\n\n* **Delay #1**: Production of the sound.   \nBetween the stim markers (channel UDIO001) and the moment where the sound card plays the sound (channel UADC001). This is mostly due to the software running on the computer (stimulation software, operating system, sound card drivers, sound card electronics). The delay can be measured from the recorded files by comparing the triggers in the two channels: Delay **between 11.5ms and 12.8ms** (std = 0.3ms) This delay is **not constant**, we will need to correct for it.\n* **Delay #2**: Transmission of the sound.   \nBetween when the sound card plays the sound and when the subject receives the sound in the ears. This is the time it takes for the transducer to convert the analog audio signal into a sound, plus the time it takes to the sound to travel through the air tubes from the transducer to the subject's ears. This delay cannot be estimated from the recorded signals: before the acquisition, we placed a sound meter at the extremity of the tubes to record when the sound is delivered. Delay **between 4.8ms and 5.0ms** (std = 0.08ms). At a sampling rate of 2400Hz, this delay can be considered **constant**, we will not compensate for it.\n* **Delay #3**: Recording of the signals.   \nThe CTF MEG systems have a constant delay of **4 samples** between the MEG/EEG channels and the analog channels (such as the audio signal UADC001), because of an anti-aliasing filtered that is applied to the first and not the second. This translate here to a **constant delay** of **1.7ms**.\n* **Delay #4**: Over-compensation of delay #1.   \nWhen correcting of delay #1, the process we use to detect the beginning of the triggers on the audio signal (UADC001) sets the trigger in the middle of the ramp between silence and the beep. We \"over-compensate\" the delay #1 by 1.7ms. This can be considered as **constant delay** of about **-1.7ms**.\n* **Uncorrected delays**: We will correct for the delay #1, and keep the other delays (#2, #3 and #4). After we compensate for delay #1 our MEG signals will have a **constant delay** of about 4.9 + 1.7 - 1.7 = **4.9 ms**. We decide not to compensate for th3se delays because they do not introduce any jitter in the responses and they are not going to change anything in the interpretation of the data.\n\n#### Head shape and fiducial points\n\n* 3D digitization using a Polhemus Fastrak device driven by Brainstorm (S01_20131218_*.pos)\n* More information: [Digitize EEG electrodes and head shape][3]\n* The output file is copied to each .ds folder and contains the following entries:\n    * The position of the center of CTF coils\n    * The position of the anatomical references we use in Brainstorm: Nasion and connections tragus/helix, as illustrated [here][4].\n\n* Around 150 head points distributed on the hard parts of the head (no soft tissues)\n\n#### Subject anatomy\n* Subject with 1.5T MRI\n* Marker on the left cheek\n* Processed with FreeSurfer 5.3\n\n\n[1]: http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/CiteBrainstorm\n[2]: http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=2300\n[3]: http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/TutDigitize\n[4]: http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/CoordinateSystems#Pre-auricular_points_.28LPA.2C_RPA.29\n[5]: http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/Auditory\n\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure de-identification of subjects.

    "license": "NIDO Terms and Conditions\n\nIn accessing data from one or more of the datasets within the NIMH Intramural Data-sharing with OpenNeuro repository (NIDO) for the purpose of scientific investigation or the planning of clinical research studies as described in the following Data Use Agreement (DUA). I, and my collaborating investigators at my institution, agree to the following terms:\n\n1. Non-Identification of Subjects\nData collected by the Submitters have been stripped of all individual identifiers, but the unique and intrinsically personal nature of genomics data, brain imaging, and other derivative data of which are included in these repositories, combined with the recent increase in the accessibility of conducting genotype and other sequence analyses (in terms of technological capacity and cost), has altered the framework through which “identify-ability” can be defined.To protect and assure the confidentiality and privacy of all participants, the Recipient who accesses these data is expected to adhere to the specifications of this DUA. Failure to do so could result in denial of further access to NIDO. Recipient agrees that data will not be used to establish the individual identities of any of the study participants from whom data were obtained and/or contact the individual study participant, except as permitted by law (e.g., in connection with a separately negotiated collaboration with the original research team or the enrollment of the consented subject in the Recipient’s study). Recipient agrees to notify the NIMH Data Science and Sharing Team at NIMHdsst@nih.gov as soon as possible if, upon use of NIDO data, the Recipient discovers identifying information in that data.\n\n2. GUID and Access to Submitted Data\nThe Global Unique Identifier (GUID) is a computer-generated alphanumeric code that is unique to each research participant. The GUID allows NIMH Data Repositories to link together all submitted information on a single participant, giving researchers access to information even if the data were collected at different locations or through different studies. If Recipients request access to data on individuals for whom they themselves have previously submitted data to NIMH Data Repositories, they may gain access to more data about an individual participant than they themselves collected. Consequently, these research activities may be considered “human subjects research” within the scope of 45 C.F.R. 46. Recipients Must comply with the requirements contained in 45 C.F.R. 46, as applicable, which may require that they obtain IRB approval of their Research Project. For more guidance, check with your local IRB and/or the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).\n\n3. Data Disclaimers\nRecipient acknowledges that the NIH does not and cannot warrant the results that may be obtained by using any data included therein. The NIH disclaims all warranties as to the accuracy of the data in NIDO or the performance or fitness of the data for any particular purpose.\n\n4. Notification to the NIH of Publication\nRecipient agrees to promptly notify the NIH via email at NIMHdsst@nih.gov as to when and where a publication (or other public disclosure) from the Research Project will appear, whether reporting positive or negative results. The notification will include the title, authors, place of publication, and publication date. \n\n5. Data Access for Research\nData in NIDO  are eligible for access by qualified researchers, pursuant to the terms set forth in this DUA. Recipients acknowledge that other researchers have access to the data and that downloading, utilization, and duplication of research is a distinct possibility.\n\n6. Acknowledgments\nNIDO is based on OpenNeuro from Stanford’s Center for Reproducible Neuroscience\nPlease cite the below reference in any publication using this data.\n\n7. Non-Governmental Endorsement; Liability\nRecipient agrees not to claim, infer, or imply endorsement by the United States Government,the Department of Health & Human Services, the National Institute of Health, or the National Institute of Mental Health of the Research Project, the entity, or personnel conducting the Research Project or any resulting commercial product(s). The United States Government assumes no liability except to the extent provided under the Federal Tort Claims Act (28U.S.C. § 2671-2680).\n\n8. Recipient's Compliance with Institutional Requirements\nRecipient acknowledges that access, is for research that is approved by the Institution, which must be operating under an Office of Human Research Protections-approved Federal-wide Assurance. Furthermore, Recipient agrees to comply with all applicable rules for the protection of human subjects, which may include Department of Health and Human Services regulations at 45 C.F.R. Part 46, and other federal and state laws for the use of this data. Recipient agrees to report promptly to the NIH any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others. This DUA is made in addition to, and does not supersede, any of Recipient's institutional policies or any local, State, and/or Federal laws and regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.\n\n9. Recipient’s Permission to Post Information Publicly\nRecipient agrees to permit the NIH to summarize, on the appropriate NIDO web site, the Recipient’s research use of data along with the Recipient’s name and organizational/institutional affiliation.\n\n10. Privacy Act Notification\nThe Recipient agrees that information collected from the Recipient, as part of registering for NIDO or accessing NIDO’s web pages, may be made public in part or in whole for tracking and reporting purposes. This Privacy Act Notification is provided pursuant to Public Law 93-579, Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. Section 552a. Authority for the collection of the information requested below from the recipient comes from the authorities regarding the establishment of the National Institutes of Health, its general authority to conduct and fund research and to provide training assistance, and its general authority to maintain records in connection with these and its other functions (42U.S.C. 203, 241, 289l-1 and 44 U.S.C. 3101), and Section 301 and 493 of the Public Health Service Act. These records will be maintained in accordance with the Privacy Act System of Record Notice 09-25-0156 (http://oma.od.nih.gov/public/ms/privacy/pafiles/0156.htm) covering “Records of Participants in Programs and Respondents in Surveys Used to EvaluatePrograms of the Public Health Service, HHS/PHS/NIH/OD.” The primary uses of this information are to document, track, and monitor and evaluate the use of the NIDO  datasets, as well as to notify interested recipients of updates, corrections or other changes to the database.

    "description": "A major limitation to structural and functional MRI (fMRI) scans is their susceptibility to head motion artifacts. Even sub-millimeter movements can systematically distort functional connectivity, morphometric, and diffusion imaging results.\nIn patient care, sedation is often used to minimize head motion, but it incurs increased costs and risks. In research settings, sedation is typically not an ethical option. Therefore, safe methods that reduce head motion are critical for\nimproving MRI quality, especially in high movement individuals such as children and neuropsychiatric patients. We investigated the effects of (1) viewing movies and (2) receiving real-time visual feedback about head\nmovement in 24 children (5-15 years old). Children completed fMRI scans during which they viewed a fixation cross (i.e., rest) or a cartoon movie clip, and during some of the scans they also received real-time visual feedback\nabout head motion. Head motion was significantly reduced during movie watching compared to rest and when receiving feedback compared to receiving no feedback. However, these results depended largely on age, such that the effects\nwere driven by the younger children. Children older than 10 years showed no significant benefit. We also found that viewing movies significantly altered the functional connectivity of fMRI data, suggesting that fMRI scans during\nmovies cannot be equated to standard resting-state fMRI scans. The implications of these results are twofold: (1) given the reduction in head motion with behavioral interventions, these methods should be tried first for all\nclinical and structural MRIs in lieu of sedation; and (2) for fMRI research scans, these methods can reduce head motion in certain groups, but investigators must keep in mind the effects on functional MRI data.\n\n### Comments added by Open-fmri Curators ###\n===========================================\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure de-identification of subjects.

    "description": "This dataset contains resting state data collected using a multiband, multiecho simultaneous pseudocontinous ASL (pCASL) and BOLD acquisition. Additional information regarding the sequence is as follows:\n\nThe sequence consists of an unbalanced pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) tagging module, followed by a post labeling delay period (PLD). Following the PLD, a multiband excitation and multi-echo, gradient-echo EPI readout was implemented. Blipped-CAIPI was also applied to reduce g-factor noise amplification caused by the slice-unaliasing in MB imaging. Each echo in the multi-echo acquisition was obtained consecutively as part of one shot. The last repetition is the M0 image collected for quantification of CBF.\nEach subject underwent one bilateral finger tapping task MBME ASL/BOLD scan, which utilized an unbalanced pCASL labeling scheme with labeling time=1.5 s and PLD=1.5 s. A partial k-space acquisition was employed with 20 overscan lines. To keep the later TEs within reasonable ranges and reduce total readout time, in-plane acceleration was employed with R=2.

    "description": "# Visual image reconstruction\n\nOriginal paper: Miyawaki Y, Uchida H, Yamashita O, Sato M, Morito Y, Tanabe HC, Sadato N & Kamitani Y (2008) Visual Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity using a Combination of Multiscale Local Image Decoders. Neuron 60:915-929.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is the fMRI data from Miyawaki et al. (2008) \"Visual image reconstruction from human brain activity using a combination of multiscale local image decoders\". Neuron 60:915-29. In this study, we collected fMRI activity from subjects viewing images, and constructed decoders predicting local image contrast at multiple spatial scales. The combined decoders based on a linear model successfully reconstructed presented stimuli from fMRI activity.\n\n## Task\n\nThe experiment consisted of human subjects viewing contrast-based images of 12 x 12 flickering patches. There were two types of image viewing tasks: (1) random image viewing and (2) figure image (geometric shape or alphabet letter) viewing. For image presentation, a block design was used with rest periods between the presentation of each image. For random image patch presentation, images were presented for 6 s, followed by 6 s rest. For figure image presentation, images were presented for 12 s, followed by 12 s rest. The data from random image viewing runs were used to train the decoding models, and the trained model were evaluated with the data from figure image viewing runs.\n\n## Dataset\n\nThis dataset contains two subjects ('sub-01' and 'sub-02'). The subjects performed two sessions of fMRI experiments ('ses-01' and 'ses-02'). Each session is composed of several EPI runs (TR, 2000 ms; TE, 30 ms; flip angle, 80°; voxel size, 3 × 3 × 3 mm; FOV, 192 × 192 mm; number of slices, 30, slice gap, 0 mm) and inplane T2-weighted imaging (TR, 6000 ms; TE, 57 ms; flip angle, 90°; voxel size, 0.75 × 0.75 × 3.0 mm; FOV, 192 × 192 mm). The EPI images covered the entire occipital lobe. The dataset also includes a T1-weighted anatomical reference image for each subject (TR, 2250 ms; TE, 2.98 ms for sub-01 and 3.06 ms for sub-02; TI, 900 ms; flip angle, 9°; voxel size, 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm; FOV, 256 × 256 mm). The T1w images were obtained in sessions different from the fMRI experiment sessions and stored in 'ses-anat' directories. The T1w images were defaced by pydeface (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydeface>). All DICOM files are converted to Nifti-1 files by mri_convert in FreeSurfer. In addition, the dataset contains mask images of manually defined ROIs for each subjects in `sourcedata` directory (See `README` in `sourcedata` for more details).\n\nDuring fMRI runs, the subject viewed contrast-based images of 12 × 12 flickering image patches. Two types of runs ('viewRandom' and 'viewFigure') were included in the experiment. In 'viewRandom' runs, random images were presented as visual stimuli. Each 'viewRandom' runs consisted of 22 stimulus presentation trials and lasted for 298 s (149 volumes). The two subjects performed 20 'viewRandom' runs. In 'viewFigure' runs, either geometric shape pattern (square, small frame, large frame, plus, X) or alphabet letter pattern (n, e, u, r, o) was presented in each trial. In addition, data while the subject viewed thin and large alphabet letter patterns (n, e, u, r, o) are included in the dataset (they are not included in the results of the original study). Each 'viewFigure' run consisted of 10 stimulus presentation trials and lasted for 268 s (134 volumes). The 'sub-01' and 'sub-02' performed 12 and 10 'viewFigure' runs, respectively.\n\nTo help subjects suppress eye blinks and firmly fixate the eyes, the color of the fixation spot changed from white to red 2 s before each stimulus block started. To ensure alertness, subjects were instructed to detect the color change of the fixation (red to green, 100 ms) that occurred after a random interval of 3–5 s from the beginning of each stimulus block. Performances of the subject was monitored online during experiments, but were not recorded and omitted from the dataset.\n\n### Task event files\n\nThe value of `trial_type` in the task event files (`*_events.tsv`) indicates the type of each trial (block) as below.\n\n- `rest`: Rest trial (no visual stimulus).\n- `stimulus_random`: Random pattern.\n- `stimulus_shape`: Geometric shape pattern (square, small frame, large frame, plus, X).\n- `stimulus_alphabet`: Alphabet pattern (n, e, u, r, o).\n- `stimulus_alphabet_thin`: Thin alphabet pattern (n, e, u, r, o).\n- `stimulus_alphabet_long`: Long alphabet pattern (n, e, u, r, o).\n\nNote that the results from thin and long alphabet patterns are not included in the original paper although the data were obtained in the same sessions.\n\nAdditional column `stimulus_pattern` contains the pattern of stimuli (12 × 12) presented in each stimulus trial. It is vectorized in row-major order. Each element in the vector corresponds to a patch (1.15° × 1.15°) in a stimulus pattern. `1` and `0` represnets a flickering checkerboard and a gray area, respectively. For example, stimulus pattern of\n\n    000000000000000000000000000000000000000111111000000111111000000110011000000110011000000110011000000110011000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\nrepresents the following stimulus.\n\n    000000000000\n    000000000000\n    000000000000\n    000111111000\n    000111111000\n    000110011000\n    000110011000\n    000110011000\n    000110011000\n    000000000000\n    000000000000\n    000000000000\n\nThe column holds 'null' for rest trials.\n\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure de-identification of subjects.

PLOS One (in press). The data were collected at York University, Toronto, Ontario. The dataset contains functional images from 20, right-handed women: 10 who play action video games more than 10 hours per week and 10 who play little to no action video games.  Functional data were collected using two, slow event-related visually-guided hand movement tasks. In the Standard task, the eyes and hand moved to the same cued spatial location.  In the Non-Standard or Dissociated task the eyes moved to the cued spatial location and the hand moved 180 degrees in the opposite direction.  All trials were structured with a cue period (2.5 seconds), followed by an instructed delay period (10 seconds), followed by a go signal and movement period (2.5 seconds).  Four experimental runs containing both conditions (in random order) with 10 trials per condition were collected.  A separate but similarly structured run was used for independent functional localization.",

The .pos files contain:\n        * The center of the CTF coils,\n        * The anatomical references we use in Brainstorm: nasion and ears as illustrated here,\n\t* Around 100 head points distributed on the hard parts of the head (no soft tissues). \n\n\n# Subject anatomy\n\n    - Structural T1 image (defaced for anonymization purposes)\n    - Processed with FreeSurfer 5.3\n    - The anatomical fiducials (NAS, LPA, RPA) have already been marked and saved in the files fiducials.m \n\n\n\n\nThe data in this dataset has been organized according to the BIDS specifications (Brain Imaging Data Structure, http://bids.neuroimaging.io) \n\n\nRelease history:\n2016-12-01: initial release\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure de-identification of subjects. The code\ncan be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface\nmri_deface was used on all T1.mgz images located in derivatives. Learn more about it here:\nhttps://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_deface\n\nQuality Control\n---------------\nMRIQC could not be run on this dataset. It will be included in a future revision.\n\nWhere to discuss the dataset\n----------------------------\n1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds000247/ See the comments section at the bottom of the dataset\npage.\n2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with the tags openfmri and ds000247.\n3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org.
