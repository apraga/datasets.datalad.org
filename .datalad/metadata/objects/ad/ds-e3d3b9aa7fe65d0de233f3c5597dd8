"description":
"These experiments probe neural dynamics in the anterior motor cortex (ALM) and its relationship to voluntary movement.  The data represent extracellular recordings from ALM neurons of adult mice performing a tactile decision behavior.  Mouse uses whisker to detect which of two possible positions a pole is in.  After a delay, the mice indicate the pole position by licking a sensor either on the right or left.  During the experiment extracellular recordings were made from ALM neurons using 32 channels.  Photostimulation was used to generate antidromic spikes in either layer 5 IT (Intratelencephalic) neuron axons through a cranial window over contra-lateral ALM or PT (Pyramidal Tract) neuron axons through an optical fiber in the ipsi-lateral brainstem.",
