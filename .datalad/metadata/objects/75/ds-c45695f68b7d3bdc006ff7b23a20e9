"description":
"This dataset contains resting state data collected using a multiband, multiecho simultaneous pseudocontinous ASL (pCASL) and BOLD acquisition. Additional information regarding the sequence is as follows:\n\nThe sequence consists of an unbalanced pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) tagging module, followed by a post labeling delay period (PLD). Following the PLD, a multiband excitation and multi-echo, gradient-echo EPI readout was implemented. Blipped-CAIPI was also applied to reduce g-factor noise amplification caused by the slice-unaliasing in MB imaging. Each echo in the multi-echo acquisition was obtained consecutively as part of one shot. The last repetition is the M0 image collected for quantification of CBF.\nEach subject underwent one bilateral finger tapping task MBME ASL/BOLD scan, which utilized an unbalanced pCASL labeling scheme with labeling time=1.5 s and PLD=1.5 s. A partial k-space acquisition was employed with 20 overscan lines. To keep the later TEs within reasonable ranges and reduce total readout time, in-plane acceleration was employed with R=2. Additional parameters for the MBME ASL/BOLD run were as follows: number of echoes=4, TE=9.1, 25, 39.6, 54.3 ms, TR=3.5 s, MB-factor=4, number of excitations=11 (total slices=11×4=44), FOV=240 mm, resolution=3×3×3 mm, FA=90°, RF pulse width=6400 ms. Scans lasted 356s, which included 64s of calibration reps at the beginning of the scan. In total 73 repetitions were acquired.\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\nT2 data wasn’t used for any of the analysis in the paper though they were acquired as per the paper.\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure de-identification of subjects. The code\ncan be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface\n\nQuality Control\n---------------\nMRIQC was run on the dataset. Results are located in derivatives/mriqc. Learn more about it here: https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n\nWhere to discuss the dataset\n----------------------------\n1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds******/ See the comments section at the bottom of the dataset\npage.\n2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with the tags openfmri and dsXXXXXX.\n3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org. Please include the accession number in\nyour email.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------",
