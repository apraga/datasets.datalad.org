"description":
"This data set contains recordings from the cortical song nucleus HVC of anesthetized male zebra finches using a 4 tetrode array. These data examine the development of a circuit essential for vocal learning and production. Juveniles, who sing plastic song, are compared to adults, who sing stable song.  These data have been used to investigate the development of motor control circuitry during a critical period in development (see papers from Nancy Day and Teresa Nick).",
