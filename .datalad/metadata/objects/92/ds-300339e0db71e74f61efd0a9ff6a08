"The data consists of in vivo whole-cell patch clamp (voltage response) recordings from 40 neurons in the primary auditory cortex of rat in response to 25 ms long pure tones of different frequencies presented repeatedly in a pseudorandom sequence. Most (29 of the 40) recordings also include simultaneously recorded local field potential (LFP) using a second patch electrode approximately 1/2 mm away from the whole-cell recording electrode.",
