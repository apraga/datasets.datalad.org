"These experiments probe neural dynamics in the mouse vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and its relationship to active touch. The data contain 52 juxtacellular loose-seal recording sessions from 21 adult mice performing a tactile decision behavior. Juxtacellular loose-seal recording are critical for recording in L4 because they fire synchronously and sparsely in time. The data also contain a complete record of the sensory and motor variables used to solve the task recorded at one millisecond resolution. The following paper describes the experiments in detail: Hires SA, Gutnisky DA, Yu J, O'connor DH, Svoboda K.
