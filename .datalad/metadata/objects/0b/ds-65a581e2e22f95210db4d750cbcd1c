"The data set contains recordings made using a silicon probe from three areas from a single rat that was performing different behavioral tasks.  The three regions recorded from are left and right hippocampal CA1 and right entorhinal cortex. The tasks are a left/right alternate selection task, wheel running, and platform exploration.   The data was recorded on 125 channels. Included in the data set are: Weveforms of putative spikes extracted from original raw broadband data; LFP (local field potential); results of spike sorting; and information about the animal behavior during the experiment.",
