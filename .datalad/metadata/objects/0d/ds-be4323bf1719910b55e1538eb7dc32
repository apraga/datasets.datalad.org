"description":
"These experiments measure neuronal responses after transiently silencing parts of mouse premotor cortex (anterior lateral motor cortex, ALM).  The data represent extracellular recordings from ALM neurons of adult mice performing pole location discrimination.  Data from 91 recording sessions are included in this release.  This dataset contains data from 19 mice (age > P60).  5 VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mice (Jackson laboratory, JAX Stock#014548) and 7 PV-ires-cre crossed to Rosa26-LSL-ReaChR, red-shifted channelrhodopsin reporter mice (JAX 24846), were used for simultaneous electrophysiology and photoinhibition.  7 mice (6 VGAT-ChR2-EYFP, 1 PV Ã— ReaChR mice) were used for the callosotomy experiment.  The experiments (including experiment methods) are described in the following publication: Li N, Daie K, Svoboda K, Druckmann S (2016).  Robust neuronal dynamics in premotor cortex during motor planning.  Nature. 7600:459-64. doi: 10.1038/nature17643",
