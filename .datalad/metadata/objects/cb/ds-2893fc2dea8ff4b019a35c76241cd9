"description":
"The data set contains recordings made from multiple anterior thalamic nuclei, mainly the antero-dorsal (AD) nucleus, and subicular areas, mainly the post-subiculum (PoS), in freely moving mice. Thalamic and subicular electrodes yielding high number of the so-called Head-Direction (HD) cells were likely to be located in the AD nucleus and the PoS, respectively. Electrode placement was confirmed by histology. The data was obtained during 42 recording sessions and includes responses of 720 neurons in the thalamus and 357 neurons in the PoS, in seven animals while they foraged for food in an open environment (53- x 46-cm).",
