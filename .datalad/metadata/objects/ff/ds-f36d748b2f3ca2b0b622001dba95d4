"description":
"The enhanced Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) is an ongoing, institutionally centered endeavor aimed at creating a large-scale (N > 1000) community sample of participants across the lifespan. Measures include a wide array of physiological and psychological assessments, genetic information, and advanced neuroimaging. Anonymized data will be publicly shared openly and prospectively (i.e., on a quarterly basis).\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health strategic plan for advancing psychiatric neuroscience calls for increased discovery science initiatives in an effort to deliniate developmental trajectories for risk and resilience across the lifespan. Such initiatives require large, openly accessible datasets that contain sufficient detail to enable the generation and testing of multiple hypotheses. The NKI-RS is intended to help meet this need.\n\nFor this release, the participant age in the participants.tsv file is the age at enrollment, while individual session TSVs contain the age of the participant when the session data was acquired and the number of minutes elapsed since the date of enrollment.",

"Next will be the breath holding task. You’re going to see some prompts appear on the screen.  Follow those prompts just like in the practice.  Remember that when you see the 'Rest' on the screen, it means you can breathe normally.  Also remember, if you can’t hold your breath for the entire time the circles are on the screen, that’s okay. Just try your best and  keep as still as possible when you’re taking those deep breaths. This scan will be about 4 minutes.",
"Next will be the checkerboard like what we practiced earlier. You're going to see a red dot appear on the screen. Keep your eyes on that red dot. Remember to press any button each time you see the checkerboard appear. This scan will be about two minutes. Please remember to stay as still as possible.",
"Ok, the music has been turned off. Were you able to hear the music? For this next scan, please keep your eyes open and look at the cross. You can blink and breathe normally but don’t strain your eyes. Try not to move. This scan will be about 10 minutes.",
"We have to turn the music off for this next scan.  You will be looking at white cross again.  Remember to keep your eyes open, and try not to move. This scan will be about 10 minutes.",
