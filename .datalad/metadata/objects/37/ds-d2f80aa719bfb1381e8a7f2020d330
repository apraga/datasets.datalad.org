"description":
"This data was collected from the Parietal Cortex of two male rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta) using single microelectrodes.  For each recording session, single-cell recordings (N=343; 219 from monkey X and 124 from monkey B) were made in the superficial cortex of the SPL (area 5), as judged by recording depth and similarity to previous recordings made in this area with standard neurophysiological techniques. Activity was recorded extracellularly with varnish-coated tungsten microelectrodes (~1- to 2-MΩ impedance at 1 kHz). Single action potentials (spikes) were isolated from the amplified and filtered (600–6,000 Hz) signal via a time-amplitude window discriminator (Plexon). Spike times were sampled at 2.5 kHz. Within a virtual reality environment where visual feedback of the limb could be manipulated, animals performed a reaction-time task involving combined eye and arm movements from a single (central) starting position to one of eight peripheral targets.  Results from the experiments are described in: Shi, Y., G. Apker, and C.A. Buneo, Multimodal representation of limb endpoint position in the posterior parietal cortex. J Neurophysiol, 2013. 109(8): p. 2097-2107. DOI: 10.1152/jn.00223.2012 And another manuscript which is currently under review.",
