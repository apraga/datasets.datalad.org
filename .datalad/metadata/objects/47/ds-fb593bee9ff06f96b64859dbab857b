"description":
"This data set contains BOLD fMRI responses in human subjects viewing natural images.  Analysis of this data showed that it was possible to determine which of many images a human subject was looking at from the observed fMRI responses. These results received wide-spread media coverage because they demonstrated a kind of \"mind reading\".",
