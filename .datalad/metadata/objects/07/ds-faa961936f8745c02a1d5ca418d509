"description":
"The data sets consist of whole cell current clamp slice electrophysiology recordings made from single neurons from coronal sections of the visual cortex of adult male mice. The experiments were performed in the presence of blockers of fast synaptic transmission with the goal of understanding the diversity of intrinsic neuronal excitability between cell classes. These experiments represent preliminary datasets being used to refine methods working towards producing slice electrophysiology data at scale.",
