"This data set contains multiunit recordings of neurons in the thalamic nucleus Uvaeformis (Uva) of adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia gutatta) during singing (n=3 birds, >90 days post hatch). In addition, we have included song recordings from adult birds pre- and post-lesion of Uva. The results are reported in: Danish HH, Aronov D, Fee MS. Rhythmic syllable-related activity in a songbird motor thalamic nucleus necessary for learned vocalizations. PLoS One, (publication accepted) The methods that were used to collect this data are described in detail in the following protocol: Okubo TS, Mackevicius EL, Fee MS (Cold Spring Harb Protoc, 2014 Oct 23; 2014(12):1273-83)",
