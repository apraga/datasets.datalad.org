"This package contains some MatLab tools for estimating linear Fisher information from population data.  Also included are two datasets (one synthetic, including the ground truth information; and one recorded in macaque primary visual cortex) to test the code. The code and the data sets are described in the associated paper: Ingmar Kanitscheider, Ruben Coen-Cagli, Adam Kohn, Alexandre Pouget \"Measuring Fisher information accurately in correlated neural populations\".
