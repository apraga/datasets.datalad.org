"This data set contains about 500 single-unit recordings from different audio areas in zebra finches.  The specific areas recorded from include: Caudal Mesopallium (CM); Primary Forebrain (from subareas L1, L2a, L2b, L3 and L);  Nucleus Ovoidalis (OV); and Mesencephalicus lateral dorsalis (MLd).  In most of the experiments, recordings were collected from two brain regions simultaneously.  For each experiment multiple sound stimuli were used.  In most cases each stimulus was repeated about 10 times.",
