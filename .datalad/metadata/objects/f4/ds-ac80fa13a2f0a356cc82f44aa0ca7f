"The data contain 2-photon calcium population recordings of responses to controlled whisker stimulation in the barrel cortex of anesthetized mice. The aim was to investigate how neurons with sensitivity to different dynamic features of whisker stimuli are distributed locally across the barrel cortex. We found that nearby neurons represent diverse kinematic features, providing a rich population representation at the local scale. The results are compatible with randomly distributed selectivity to stimulus features, with no systematic additional map or ordering scheme superimposed upon the whisker map. Our data can be usefully contrasted to similar results in mouse visual and auditory cortex, and to data collected by other groups in the barrel cortex.
