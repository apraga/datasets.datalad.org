"description":
"This dataset contains patch-clamp recordings from individual pyramidal cells in layer 4 of acute slices from visual cortex area V1 in young (1-2 week old) guinea pigs. The main purpose of the experiments was to examine synaptic plasticity responses of responses evoked by electrical stimulation under normal conditions and under GABAA blockage (using bath application of bicuculline). There are three sets of data: a voltage clamp control dataset (VC, n=17), a current clamp control dataset (ICS, n=21) and a bicuculline voltage clamp dataset (VCB, n=38). Complete recordings contain a baseline of at least 10 minutes, followed by a pairing protocol in which extracellular stimulation was paired with an intracellularly-evoked (in current clamp) burst of spikes and a post-pairing epoch of at least 10 minutes. Some datasets are incomplete or were excluded from publication due to quality control (see below). This is indicated in the accompanying documentation.",
