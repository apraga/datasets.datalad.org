"description":
"These experiments measure spikes and membrane potential in the mouse somatosensory thalamocortical system (Yu, Gutnisky et al Nat. Neurosci. 2016). Mice performed an active object localizatiobn behavior (as in Oâ€™Connor, D JNS 2010). Importantly, whisker movements and touch forces were tracked with millisecond time-scale precision (as in Pammer et al JNS 2013; Hires, Gutnisky et al ELife 2015). Spikes were recorded in VPM, L4 excitatory neurons, and L4 fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Importantly, L4 recordings were made with loos-seal pipettes to avoid sampling bias. Membrane potential is in addition recorded in L4 excitatory neurons and L4 fast-spiking neurons. Various optogenetic manipulations were performed to identify neuron types and to analyze the flow of excitation in the circuit.",
