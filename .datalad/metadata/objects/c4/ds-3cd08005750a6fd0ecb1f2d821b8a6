"description":
"The data was recorded in the lab of Loren Frank at UCSF from hippocampus regions in nine male Long-Evans rats before, during and after the animals performed an alternate choice task in one of two W-shaped tracks.  In two animals, recordings were from areas MEC and CA1; for the other seven animals, recordings were from CA1 and CA3.  The data was used to determine relationships between activity in hippocampus neurons to information representation, learning and decision making.",
