"description":
"These experiments were performed to measure the spatiotemporal receptive fields  of cortical cells.  The data were obtained with extra-cellular recordings from the primary visual cortex of anesthetized adult cats.  Visual stimuli were one-dimensional white noise (random bars) and two-dimensional stimuli (natural images, natural phase, and random phase).",
