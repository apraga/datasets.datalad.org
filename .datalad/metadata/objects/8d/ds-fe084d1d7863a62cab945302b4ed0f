"Description of the ASL sequence\nA sequence with pseudo-continuous labeling, background suppression and 3D RARE Stack-Of-Spirals readout with optional through-plane acceleration was implemented for this study. At the beginning of the sequence, gradients were rapidly played with alternating polarity to correct for their delay in the spiral trajectories, followed by two preparation TRs, to allow the signal to reach the steady state. A non-accelerated readout was played during the preparation TRs, in order to obtain a fully sampled k-space dataset, used for calibration of the parallel imaging reconstruction kernel, needed to reconstruct the skipped kz partitions in the accelerated images.\n\nDescription of study\nPerfusion data were acquired on an elderly cohort using the single-shot, accelerated sequence.\nFor each participant, first a high-resolution anatomical T1-weighted image was acquired with a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence.\nResting perfusion data were acquired with a 1-shot 1D-accelerated readout for a total scan duration of 5 min, with labeling and PLD times of 1.5 and 1.5 s. Two M0 images with long TR and no magnetization preparation were acquired per run for CBF quantification purposes.\n\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects.
