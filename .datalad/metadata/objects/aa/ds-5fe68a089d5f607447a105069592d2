Because scanning sessions whose behavioral accuracy was less than 70 % were excluded from further analysis(page 4, line 39-40).\n\n3.

The code\ncan be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface\n\nQuality Control\n---------------\nMriqc was run on the dataset. Results are located in derivatives/mriqc. Learn more about it here: https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nWhere to discuss the dataset\n----------------------------\n1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds******/ See the comments section at the bottom of the dataset\npage.\n2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with the tags openfmri and dsXXXXXX.\n3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org. Please include the accession number in\nyour email.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\nFollowing files as reported by vids-validator warnings are not included with the dataset. AS per submitter\"These missing data were excluded because the behavioral accuracy rate was less than 70%for these scanning sessions.\"\n\n1: Not all subjects contain the same files. Each subject should contain the same number of files with the same naming unless some files are known to be missing.
