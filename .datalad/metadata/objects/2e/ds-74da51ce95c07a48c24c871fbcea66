"description":
"These data contain a record of neuron spiking activity in mouse somatosensory cortex. The recordings were performed in organotypic slice cultures after 2 to 4 weeks in vitro. The recordings were performed with a large and dense multielectrode array (512 electrodes, 60 μm interelectrode spacing, 5 μm electrode diameter, flat electrodes, roughly 1 mm by 2 mm total array area).  The cultures were not stimulated, so these data represent spontaneous activity. The spiking activity was spike sorted using PCA. Details about the recording method and results from these particular data are presented in publications that are referenced in the documentation for the data.  All data are stored as Matlab files using standard Matlab structures.",
